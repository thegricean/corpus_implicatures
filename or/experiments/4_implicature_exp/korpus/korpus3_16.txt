50849:39	i don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private charity that's put it together.	###SpeakerA61*t61 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB62*t61 . ###SpeakerA63*t63 . ###And it was definitely voluntary , too . E_S ###They were not drafting you and sending you , against your will . E_S ###SpeakerB64*t64 . ###Right .

E_S ###But I do n't know what organization it 's under -N404278 . E_S 	i don't know if it's a government run   or if it's a private   charity but not both that 's put it together.
35761:57	he said, you're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage.	###SpeakerA161*t161 . ###So , I figured out a price based on that . E_S ###SpeakerB162*t162 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's good . E_S ###SpeakerA163*t163 . ###But \[ I , \+ I \] guess -NONE- I got a pretty good deal , because I went back to the Town North Mazda right off Central and offered them the same price as what I knew -NONE- I was going -N40725A to be able -N40726D to get it for -N407284 in Arlington E_S ###SpeakerB164*t164 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA165*t164 . ###SpeakerB166*t166 . ###Right .

E_S ###But my experience has been that most people that -N40171E move into nursing homes die very quickly .

E_S ###But I think -NONE- the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home -N401A3C is only like six months or something . E_S ###SpeakerB18*t18 . ###Well a lot of it 's probably -N401B60 to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help . E_S ###SpeakerA19*t19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20*t20 . ###They need health care E_S ###so they 're already ill before they go . E_S ###SpeakerA21*t21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB22*t22 . ###That 's probably a large factor .
