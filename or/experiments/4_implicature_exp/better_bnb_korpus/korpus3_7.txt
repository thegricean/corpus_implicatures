E_S ###SpeakerA21*t21 . ###No , E_S ###it 's very hard E_S ###because , see , well , I mean , in the whole spectrum I 'd rather listen , you know , E_S 	i listen to heavy metal or classic rock but not both.
139930:62	uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy.	###But , uh , \[ i- , \+ it 's \] worth it once you get it .

E_S ###SpeakerA127*t127 . 	uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy but not both.
168937:102	and, so, uh, one of the things that would fulfill the, at least the nominal, uh, qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft.	###SpeakerA10*t10 . ###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think -NONE- the question is posed -N400878 somewhat strangely because , uh , it 's talking about a requirement for public service E_S ###SpeakerB11*t11 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA19*t19 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that probably is a little bit under what it is -N4013DB for this time of year . E_S ###I think , E_S ###I have n't seen \[ the wea- , \+ the weather \] on the news in the evening lately , E_S ###but I think -NONE- the average high \[ would be , \+ should be \] about seventy .

E_S ###SpeakerB22*t22 . ###Well , I like it when it 's sort of a medium temperature , uh , maybe seventy-five to eighty , somewhere in there -N4017B4 . E_S 	i don't like it when it's too cool or too warm but not both .
9072:53	well, i was just going to say, it's a little over six or seven minutes.	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA61*t61 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB62*t62 . ###About the same time that you plant okra -N404EA9 because it 's supposed -N404EC0 to be warm . E_S ###SpeakerA63*t63 . ###Well , that 's true .
