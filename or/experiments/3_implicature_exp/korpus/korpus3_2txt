62903:64	and it kind of has to start from the top and, and go clea-, or from the bottom maybe and go clear up.	###SpeakerA139*t139 . ###Well , they may cost a little more , E_S ###but they do n't have -N407FF8 to take them to the shop every other day .

20456:39	my parents, uh, bought a home in san diego about four or five years ago,	###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerA85*t85 . ###that 's once a month . E_S ###SpeakerB86*t86 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerA87*t87 . ###Well , I get twenty six paychecks , which -N404F3A would come out -N404F4D to be in thirteen months . E_S ###SpeakerB88*t88 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA89*t89 . ###So if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks , Instead of once a month , you 'll come out -N4050BA paying \[ a , \+ \] uh , one month extra every year .

99028:72	so we don't know what is really going on, what is, uh, really the range of sentences or awards that are, uh, are actually, uh, in the end applied.	###I mean not everybody \[ is , \+ you know , has , \] \+ has \] the right morals sometimes .

E_S ###SpeakerB25*t25 . ###and sometimes that 's not real fair either , though E_S ###so , E_S ###SpeakerA26*t26 . ###Well , one of the others things that -N40285C gets me \[ on , \+ on \] the juries is that often in the newspaper , \[ I , \+ I \] tend -N4028C3 to hear two things \[ that , \+ well , that \] -N4028EE go on . E_S ###One is , -NONE- you often see in the headlines the big numbers . E_S ###SpeakerB27*t27 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA30*t30 . ###and that never makes \[ the , \+ the \] press E_S ###and so , when , uh , you or I as an individual gets on a jury -N402DE4 we tend -N402DF3 to have certain mental images of what -N402E16 's what because we see the headlines , uh , E_S ###and we do n't have , \[ a- , \+ again , \] a lot of knowledge , E_S 	so we don't know what  is really going on, what  is, uh, really the range of sentences or awards but not both that  are, uh, are actually, uh, in the end applied .
107053:97	and then at the end of the, of the period, pay period, if she has any left, that much is for fun or entertainment.	###Uh , but that depends , you know , on the individual if they can I guess have self-control .

E_S ###SpeakerA11*t11 . ###and you put the cash in envelopes marked -NONE- for that . E_S ###So you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera .

E_S ###And she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope , what she 's buying -N400E64 . E_S ###SpeakerB12*t12 . ###Uh-huh .
