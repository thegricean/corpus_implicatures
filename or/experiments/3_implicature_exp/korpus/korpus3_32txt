18802:68	and the garbage men come by and, uh, collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape.	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11*t10 . ###SpeakerB12*t12 . ###I think -NONE- that 's great . E_S ###There 's a few places in Houston where they 're trying that out -N400C1C .

E_S ###SpeakerA17*t17 . ###and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags .

123608:48	i think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after.	###Uh , Baltimore is trying -N403C2F to get a team , E_S ###and there 's some other city .

E_S 	i think they are supposed  to put two in by either next year or the year after but not both.
116923:70	and, if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble, just get out of it or call for help, whichever.	###I do n't blame people with today 's society about -NONE- going out -N40259B to help themselves . E_S ###SpeakerB40*t40 . ###Right , E_S ###well , I can see , you know , especially if you heard screams from a house or something , -NONE- not going over there maybe , because , you know , it could be dangerous , E_S ###but certainly I ca n't understand -NONE- not calling the police .

155051:35	well, how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances.	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4*t4 . ###So \[ I , \+ I \] kind of gave up on the idea of -N400663 using Quicken , at least for now . E_S ###SpeakerA5*t5 . ###Um . I 've found -NONE- it 's the only reliable way -NONE- -NONE- to keep a check book balanced -N4007A6 -N4007AD actually because what -N4007C0 will happen is -NONE- my wife will write a few checks and then , well , uh , uh , not bother -N40081F to total it E_S ###SpeakerB6*t6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7*t7 . ###and then it comes in to -NONE- doing all the arithmetic . E_S ###So it really helps with that . E_S ###SpeakerB8*t8 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , it 's similar problems E_S ###but , uh , we just have the one check book E_S ###and we try -N400BF0 to keep it up to date as much as possible E_S ###and occasionally we will get behind like you say E_S ###but , uh , it does n't really seem -N400D54 to be \[ too , \+ too \] tight if we just remember -N400D8F to keep everything \[ up , \+ up \] to date and balanced .
