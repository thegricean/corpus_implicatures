169332:97	and the view that i would rather take --n401ab1 is that there's a different amount of information you need --n401ae8 when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in --n401b2b buying something as a, you know as a hobbyist --n401b5a versus when you want --n401b71 to go out and buy a blender because you need --n401ba0 to mix things --n401bb3.	and the view that i would rather take --n401ab1 is that there's a different amount of information you need --n401ae8 when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in --n401b2b buying something as a, you know as a hobbyist --n401b5a versus when you want --n401b71 to go out and buy a blender because you need --n401ba0 to mix things --n401bb3, but not both.	###uh-huh.###speakerb18t17.###speakera19t19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20t19.###speakera21t21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22t22.###and, uh, i guess you could explain it two ways.### and, and the cynical view is, well these things aren't doing a very good job at all.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S
169350:140	if you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print --n40223a is stuff that you probably knew --n402259 already and the stuff that you want --n40227c they're not printing --n402293 because the average person doesn't need or want --n4022be to know that much.	if you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print --n40223a is stuff that you probably knew --n402259 already and the stuff that you want --n40227c they're not printing --n402293 because the average person doesn't need or want --n4022be to know that much, but not both.	###yeah.###speakerb28t28.###and i think the same thing is true with news.###if you want --n401f69 to just have an idea as to what --n401f90's going on, most papers, a-, and especially the better papers, the, the times, the wall street journal, the washington post give you a reasonable idea.###speakera29t29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30t29.###speakera31t31.###yeah.###speakerb32t32.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S

169950:101	i used --n404880 to initially think that the only people who --n4048a7 went into such residences were people who, uh, --n4048d6 were adequately deficient in their abilities, uh physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves.	i used --n404880 to initially think that the only people who --n4048a7 went into such residences were people who, uh, --n4048d6 were adequately deficient in their abilities, uh physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves, but not both.	###there's nothing, maybe a picture or two that --n404022 belongs to that person###and that's it.###but this room, on the other hand, you know, they got rid --n404149 of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that###and they had all their stuff from their house###and it looked like, uh, i-, i-, it must have been,###it --n4043f0 was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them###and it must also give them a sense of, uh, uh, security and, and, uh, and, and, you know, s-, s-, uh,###speakerb37t37.###yeah,### i, i think part of what you're saying --n40472d matches what i h-, have read --n404750.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S
170074:84	and it, that i, i don't know if i ever went as far as three months --n4026cd or not i-, i-, in --n4026fc keeping that kind of data.	and it, that i, i don't know if i ever went as far as three months --n4026cd or not i-, i-, in --n4026fc keeping that kind of data, but not both.	###things would get to tight.###uh, and sometimes what i would do --n402201 is keep a piece of paper in my wallet###and every time i, uh, i spent money, i mean cash mostly --n402327, i would, uh, write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent --n40238a on food so i could do better planning.###speakerb32t32.###uh-huh.###speakera33t32.###speakerb34t34.###uh-huh.###speakera35t35.###but i would forget --n4025e2 to write the things down	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	yes	yes	S
