12164:39	but if you was talking about something which --n40760d was more or less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle, had --n407658 to pay a pollution tax, uh, this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters,	but if you was talking about something which --n40760d was more or less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle, had --n407658 to pay a pollution tax, uh, this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters, but not both.	but if you was talking about something which --n40760d was mande and less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle, had --n407658 to pay a pollution tax, uh, this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters,	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off.###speakera115t115.###yeah,###if you can take a muffler off and only replace,###well not unless it was built --n407514 into every muffler.###speakerb116t116.###right.###speakera117t117.###and that's mumblex.###speakerb118t118.

48855:166	uh, you know, it, it --n400bc2 really irks me to see so much effort put --n400bf5 into preventing someone being put --n400c14 to death by the state when they so callously and usually so, you know, without --n400c5f even thinking or without any concern, uh, you know, end somebody else's life, and in a lot of cases several people's lives --n400cd6.	uh, you know, it, it --n400bc2 really irks me to see so much effort put --n400bf5 into preventing someone being put --n400c14 to death by the state when they so callously and usually so, you know, without --n400c5f even thinking or without any concern, uh, you know, end somebody else's life, and in a lot of cases several people's lives --n400cd6, but not both.	uh, you know, it, it --n400bc2 really irks me to see so much effandt put --n400bf5 into preventing someone being put --n400c14 to death by the state when they so callously and usually so, you know, without --n400c5f even thinking and without any concern, uh, you know, end somebody else's life, and in a lot of cases several people's lives --n400cd6.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###but i don't,### seems --n400698 to be a lot of controversy about that.###speakerb2t2.###yeah.###speakera3t2.###speakerb4t4.###uh, uh, i tend --n400773 to agree with you, uh, you know,###probably pretty similar views on it,###but that's, that's one of the things i don't, don't understand --n4008fc is, is so much of the controversy###because, uh, you know, i, i do also, myself, believe in capital punishment, uh,

98870:28	in this country, and for example with alcohol or with drugs is, we don't seem --n405d7d to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay, it is okay under these circumstances, but if you step outside these bounds, the punishment is extreme --n405e08.	in this country, and for example with alcohol or with drugs is, we don't seem --n405d7d to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay, it is okay under these circumstances, but if you step outside these bounds, the punishment is extreme --n405e08, but not both.	in this country, and fand example with alcohol and with drugs is, we don't seem --n405d7d to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay, it is okay under these circumstances, but if you step outside these bounds, the punishment is extreme --n405e08.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###and drunk driving is a good one,### is that people are well indoctrinated --n405af6 in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable.###speakerb101t101.###right.###speakera102t102.###and, yeah,###if you're going --n405c18 to drink, and you may drink, you better have your designated driver.###speakerb103t103.###uh-huh.###speakera104t104.

98968:82	and, uh, many matters are so complicated that it --n400fe3's so hard to, uh, come up with the fair value, uh, or the fair sentence	and, uh, many matters are so complicated that it --n400fe3's so hard to, uh, come up with the fair value, uh, or the fair sentence, but not both.	and, uh, many matters are so complicated that it --n400fe3's so hard to, uh, come up with the fair value, uh, and the fair sentence	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###i think the judges should,###or even a panel of, of lawyers if, if it got to that point. might be better at than just regular civil people. not knowing, you know, exactly what things are --n400abf, from, from murder on up to like tax stuff, you know.###speakera6t6.###uh-huh.###speakerb7t6.###speakera8t8.###yeah.###because i find that, uh,###i've been on a few juries###and, uh, as a say, i, i tend --n400e57 to be around, uh, civil cases because i've been an expert witness some,
98974:28	when i only do something one, two or three times --n4013d9 i'm hardly an expert on it,	when i only do something one, two or three times --n4013d9 i'm hardly an expert on it, but not both.	when i only do something one, two and three times --n4013d9 i'm hardly an expert on it,	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	###yeah.###because i find that, uh,###i've been on a few juries###and, uh, as a say, i, i tend --n400e57 to be around, uh, civil cases because i've been an expert witness some,###and, uh, many matters are so complicated that it --n400fe3's so hard to, uh, come up with the fair value, uh, or the fair sentence###and one thing that you get --n40114f if you have some expertise is, uh, you know the range of, of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime --n4011ce.###speakerb9t9.###right.###speakera10t10.###uh, that, uh,
98975:26	and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three.	and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three, but not both.	and most juries over a period of five and ten years you might sit on three.	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	###because i find that, uh,###i've been on a few juries###and, uh, as a say, i, i tend --n400e57 to be around, uh, civil cases because i've been an expert witness some,###and, uh, many matters are so complicated that it --n400fe3's so hard to, uh, come up with the fair value, uh, or the fair sentence###and one thing that you get --n40114f if you have some expertise is, uh, you know the range of, of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime --n4011ce.###speakerb9t9.###right.###speakera10t10.###uh, that, uh,###when i only do something one, two or three times --n4013d9 i'm hardly an expert on it,

99026:26	and so, when, uh, you or i as an individual gets on a jury --n402de4 we tend --n402df3 to have certain mental images of what --n402e16's what because we see the headlines, uh,	and so, when, uh, you or i as an individual gets on a jury --n402de4 we tend --n402df3 to have certain mental images of what --n402e16's what because we see the headlines, uh, but not both.	and so, when, uh, you and i as an individual gets on a jury --n402de4 we tend --n402df3 to have certain mental images of what --n402e16's what because we see the headlines, uh,	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###well, one of the others things that --n40285c gets me on, on the juries is that often in the newspaper, i, i tend --n4028c3 to hear two things that, well, that --n4028ee go on.###one is, you often see in the headlines the big numbers.###speakerb27t27.###uh-huh.###speakera28t28.###uh, and many of those get overturned --n402bb3 or get reduced --n402bc6 in terms of sentences, or get changed --n402bed by a judge or an appeals court###speakerb29t29.###right.###speakera30t30.###and that never makes the, the press

99064:18	and you can decide guilt or innocence on that.	and you can decide guilt or innocence on that, but not both.	and you can decide guilt and innocence on that.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	### that's, that's not right.###speakera40t40.###well, that's where, uh, the role of juries is, is restricted --n404136 --n40413d###and, i'm not sure i'd want --n40422f to change that aspect of it,###one is, it's restricted --n404310 in the sense that, juries only decide the charges that --n404343 are actually, uh, brought --n404362, you know###speakerb41t41.###right.###speakera42t42.###if it's first degree rape, second deg-, degree rape or whatever, they only get --n4044f7 to decide on that,###well, okay this person has been charged --n404613 with first degree rape, uh,

105233:19	it seems like one way or the other we're going --n403646 to end up --n403659 paying for it.	it seems like one way or the other we're going --n403646 to end up --n403659 paying for it, but not both.	it seems like one way and the other we're going --n403646 to end up --n403659 paying fand it.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###speakera13t13.###right.###speakerb14t14.###so i, i would hate --n402d5a to have that responsibility just personally### but, but then, again, we really, we really do have it as a society --n402e5d to decide which things we need --n402e7c to address --n402e8b.### i, uh, i guess i, it, it --n403024 frightens me to think of so many people with, with aids and with cancer###and many of those things, uh, if they're not able --n40322c to, to be insured --n403253 then the country's going --n40326e to pay for it one way or the other. whether it's through prevention or, or treatment or, you know, just, uh, just helping the people when they are not able --n403319 to take care of themselves --n403334.###speakera15t15.###right.###speakerb16t16.
105245:83	but, the other thing that i thought of --n403bd4 on this is, i wonder if there isn't enough money, uh, in our economy or in our system.	but, the other thing that i thought of --n403bd4 on this is, i wonder if there isn't enough money, uh, in our economy or in our system, but not both.	but, the other thing that i thought of --n403bd4 on this is, i wonder if there isn't enough money, uh, in our economy and in our system.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###that's true.###speakerb18t18.###but,###speakera19t19.###you know the, the other thought that i had --n4037b0, uh,###i've had several minutes to think about this --n40389e after i, uh,###while i was finding people, i, uh, i could think about the topic longer that the person that --n4039c0 receives it,###so it's kind of a, a unfair advantage, as it were,###speakerb20t19.###speakera21t21.
105339:114	but, uh, in the long run, it seems to me, it's kind of like what they keep --n4023b9 talking --n4023c4 about the, uh, the aids testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that, you know,	but, uh, in the long run, it seems to me, it's kind of like what they keep --n4023b9 talking --n4023c4 about the, uh, the aids testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that, you know, but not both.	but, uh, in the long run, it seems to me, it's kind of like what they keep --n4023b9 talking --n4023c4 about the, uh, the aids testing with doctands and dentists and things and how that, you know,	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###speakera15t15.### i, i have a real fear, but that at some point something's going --n401d02 to happen.###and they're showing it with aids,###so why, you know,### they sh-, they ought --n401eb5 to start --n401ec4 doing something with the drugs.###so i really have no problem with it.###speakerb16t16.###yeah.###well, it's, it's unfortunate, i think --n402056, that everyone doesn't have that opinion.###uh, some people just, uh, i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that,

132530:36	and i, i think one way or the other, we're going --n4005f5 to pay for the bureaucracy, i guess --n400620.	and i, i think one way or the other, we're going --n4005f5 to pay for the bureaucracy, i guess --n400620, but not both.	and i, i think one way and the other, we're going --n4005f5 to pay fand the bureaucracy, i guess --n400620.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###uh, the only thing i'm, i'm thankful of --n40012f is that we don't have --n40014e to pay any income tax in, in texas.###speakera5t5.###well, that's probably the next year's agenda.###speakerb6t6.###yeah.###boy, i tell you what,###i sure hope they don't pass something like that.###speakera7t7.###oh, yeah.###they're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around --n4004de --n4004e5,

132601:54	well, it, it's just like having taxes on --n403070, or exemptions for --n403087 kids, you know.	well, it, it's just like having taxes on --n403070, or exemptions for --n403087 kids, you know, but not both.	well, it, it's just like having taxes on --n403070, and exemptions fand --n403087 kids, you know.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###uh, no,###i haven't,###but it, it to me it --n402ad9 seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax, uh, on top of it.###and there's an awful lot of cars that --n402c8b cost more than thirty thousand.###speakera27t27.###yeah,###there are,###there are.###and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that, i guess --n402e36, you know, unless they really want it,###buy something that, you know, more,
132615:33	now, i don't know if that's true or not,	now, i don't know if that's true or not, but not both.	now, i don't know if that's true and not,	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	yes	yes	S	###yeah.###speakera29t29.###and where you exempt things, like, uh, uh,###one of the best things i heard --n403490 on taxes to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably lloyd bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be, you know, spending more money --n403557 using their credit cards.###speakerb30t30.###right.###speakera31t30.###speakerb32t32.###right.###speakera33t33.

151762:61	it's burned --n4031bb so completely, that you don't have any, uh, nitrous oxides, uh, or oxides of nitrogen, uh, to, uh, form --n40323e because of, by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine, because diesel oil is, uh, is not very volatile. you know, where gasoline, if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone --n40330d.	it's burned --n4031bb so completely, that you don't have any, uh, nitrous oxides, uh, or oxides of nitrogen, uh, to, uh, form --n40323e because of, by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine, because diesel oil is, uh, is not very volatile. you know, where gasoline, if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone --n40330d, but not both.	it's burned --n4031bb so completely, that you don't have any, uh, nitrous oxides, uh, and oxides of nitrogen, uh, to, uh, fandm --n40323e because of, by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine, because diesel oil is, uh, is not very volatile. you know, where gasoline, if you leave a little pail of gasoline out befande long it's gone --n40330d.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###right.###speakera29t29.###but that, that particular bothers me.###speakerb30t30.###well, most, most, most of the time when you see bus, uh, you know, the busses with the diesel --n402d8c that's, uh, those are carbon particles, and carbon dioxide and water vapor, uh,###speakera31t31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32t32.###because when you, when diesel is burned --n402ffc --n403003 it's it,###you know diesel fuel is burned --n4030ed in a, in the diesel engine
151776:116	that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios --n4038c4 as the, as the air is heated, you know, by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio	that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios --n4038c4 as the, as the air is heated, you know, by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio, but not both.	that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios --n4038c4 as the, as the air is heated, you know, by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen and nineteen to one ratio	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	###speakera35t35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36t35.###speakera37t37.###yeah.###speakerb38t38.###diesel is going --n403651 to be around, because it doesn't evaporate easily,###and it's got,###well, you know, its latent heat is high,###but it's slow burning at, at, uh, normal pressures.

156987:88	but you look at our, our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to, to like texas or someplace that --n403335 does, you know, it, it, it --n403378's impossible to make a case that it's, it's affecting it in any way.	but you look at our, our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to, to like texas or someplace that --n403335 does, you know, it, it, it --n403378's impossible to make a case that it's, it's affecting it in any way, but not both.	but you look at our, our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to, to like texas and someplace that --n403335 does, you know, it, it, it --n403378's impossible to make a case that it's, it's affecting it in any way.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###yeah.###speakerb28t27.###speakera29t29.###yeah,### and, and, you know, uh, especially, now, i live in, in massachusetts, you know,### w-, w-, we're going --n403126 to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something.###speakerb30t30.###yeah.###speakera31t31.###so, you know,
157011:154	and, you know, i, i think when you listen to like the, uh, the, the victims' families and things --n403f08, they're always talking about, you know, uh, --n403f3f feeling justified or feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it,	and, you know, i, i think when you listen to like the, uh, the, the victims' families and things --n403f08, they're always talking about, you know, uh, --n403f3f feeling justified or feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it, but not both.	and, you know, i, i think when you listen to like the, uh, the, the victims' families and things --n403f08, they're always talking about, you know, uh, --n403f3f feeling justified and feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it,	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###speakera37t37.###oh, yeah###speakerb38t37.###speakera39t39.###it's mainl-, lot of blacks.###also a lot of young people.###you know, a, a, a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put --n403cee on death row from what i've seen --n403d15.###speakerb40t40.###right.###speakera41t41.
157037:38	and why, does it just turn out --n404db9 to be genetic or biochemical in origin --n404ddc.	and why, does it just turn out --n404db9 to be genetic or biochemical in origin --n404ddc, but not both.	and why, does it just turn out --n404db9 to be genetic and biochemical in andigin --n404ddc.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	SBARQ	### you, you will work your prison job###and any money you earn --n404ac4 will go to the victim's family.###speakera47t47.###right###and, the, the other thing is that, you know,###i was reading through a book on, uh, geneo, human geneo research###speakerb48t48.###uh-huh.###speakera49t49.###and there, more and more things like schizophrenia

157474:125	and i, i don't think it --n401077 would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.	and i, i don't think it --n401077 would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal, but not both.	and i, i don't think it --n401077 would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something candresponding saying that if, you know, six and seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	###speakera6t6.###yeah.###speakerb7t7.###i wonder,### the difference, yeah, the difference could be that for, uh, state, if there is such a thing, state felonies versus federal felonies that federal, things that --n400af3 are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote,###and things that --n400ce0 are under state jurisdiction, even criminal don't require,###but i don't know what the, the laws,###do you think that that's an unreasonable, uh, requirement that they be unanimous.###speakera8t8.###well, i'd be curious as to what the, uh, requirement for a, an acquittal is --n400f6d.
157511:153	well, the, the one thing that i know --n402ae2 does seem --n402af1 to happen from people i've talked to --n402b1c on this, is that in the situation you just said --n402b53 where it's nine to three, or some such number --n402b86, that there's, an effect --n402bad starts --n402bb8 being that there's starts --n402bd3 being a lot of peer pressure going on	well, the, the one thing that i know --n402ae2 does seem --n402af1 to happen from people i've talked to --n402b1c on this, is that in the situation you just said --n402b53 where it's nine to three, or some such number --n402b86, that there's, an effect --n402bad starts --n402bb8 being that there's starts --n402bd3 being a lot of peer pressure going on, but not both.	well, the, the one thing that i know --n402ae2 does seem --n402af1 to happen from people i've talked to --n402b1c on this, is that in the situation you just said --n402b53 where it's nine to three, and some such number --n402b86, that there's, an effect --n402bad starts --n402bb8 being that there's starts --n402bd3 being a lot of peer pressure going on	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###yeah,###i also think that would be really good.###i,###speakera16t16.###well, the people i know --n40242e who --n402439 have served have said that usually what --n40245c ends up --n40246b happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand --n4024ae, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying --n40255d to convince the minority that they're right###speakerb17t17.###uh-huh.###speakera18t18.###and in fact, i'm not sure that that's any more, uh, liable --n40293f to get rid --n402952 of the reasonable doubt than, than anything else.###speakerb19t19.
157526:224	some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict --n403672, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in --n4036cd knowing that nothing they could do --n4036f0 could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for --n403733 or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict.	some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict --n403672, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in --n4036cd knowing that nothing they could do --n4036f0 could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for --n403733 or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict, but not both.	some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict --n403672, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in --n4036cd knowing that nothing they could do --n4036f0 could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying fand --n403733 and a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	yes	no	yes	S	###and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire --n402feb of people --n402ffa to get out of there and not be stuck --n403025 in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons.###speakera22t22.###yeah,###i'd read one book, i think it was calls --n403230 trial by jury of all things, that, uh --n40325f went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases --n4032b2 looking at what --n4032c5 had, at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, uh, based on the deliberations.###speakerb23t23.###uh,###speakera24t23.###speakerb25t25.###uh-huh.###speakera26t26.
157597:36	and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going --n40133f to spend --n40134e and set that money aside,	and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going --n40133f to spend --n40134e and set that money aside, but not both.	and we do sit down at the beginning of every month and the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going --n40133f to spend --n40134e and set that money aside,	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###but, we have a fixed income###speakerb14t14.###oh.###speakera15t15.###and we have --n400f16 to make sure that, uh, every dollar we have --n400f51 will, is spent --n400f68 accordingly###and, uh, what we try and do --n4010a2 to, to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have, you know, the house payment,###speakerb16t16.###uh-huh.###speakera17t17.###we have the insurance premiums, uh, utilities and so forth

158077:187	and i think that the people who --n401771 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level. uh, you know, whether it be a biblical force, uh, you know, the eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a knife, life type logic or just, uh, uh, some sort of anger at putting peop-, putting, uh, murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life, uh, while we foot the bill.	and i think that the people who --n401771 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level. uh, you know, whether it be a biblical force, uh, you know, the eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a knife, life type logic or just, uh, uh, some sort of anger at putting peop-, putting, uh, murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life, uh, while we foot the bill, but not both.	and i think that the people who --n401771 are strongly in favand of the death penalty are really wandking from that gut level. uh, you know, whether it be a biblical fandce, uh, you know, the eye fand an eye, a tooth fand a tooth, a life fand a knife, life type logic and just, uh, uh, some sandt of anger at putting peop-, putting, uh, murderers up in federal pens fand the rest of their life, uh, while we foot the bill.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###oh, it's a, uh, it's a question of your, your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response.###speakera7t7.###right,###exactly.###speakerb8t8.###uh, a-, and that was the thing that, uh, --n40138a killed dukakis back, uh, four years ago when someone asked him a similar question --n4013d1###and he, he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when, uh, people wanted --n40154c to see if he was going --n40156b to go for an emotion uh, a gut level reaction --n40159e.###speakera9t9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10t10.

169332:97	and the view that i would rather take --n401ab1 is that there's a different amount of information you need --n401ae8 when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in --n401b2b buying something as a, you know as a hobbyist --n401b5a versus when you want --n401b71 to go out and buy a blender because you need --n401ba0 to mix things --n401bb3.	and the view that i would rather take --n401ab1 is that there's a different amount of information you need --n401ae8 when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in --n401b2b buying something as a, you know as a hobbyist --n401b5a versus when you want --n401b71 to go out and buy a blender because you need --n401ba0 to mix things --n401bb3, but not both.	and the view that i would rather take --n401ab1 is that there's a different amount of infandmation you need --n401ae8 when you're particularly interested in a topic and, uh, particularly interested in --n401b2b buying something as a, you know as a hobbyist --n401b5a versus when you want --n401b71 to go out and buy a blender because you need --n401ba0 to mix things --n401bb3.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###uh-huh.###speakerb18t17.###speakera19t19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20t19.###speakera21t21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22t22.###and, uh, i guess you could explain it two ways.### and, and the cynical view is, well these things aren't doing a very good job at all.
169350:140	if you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print --n40223a is stuff that you probably knew --n402259 already and the stuff that you want --n40227c they're not printing --n402293 because the average person doesn't need or want --n4022be to know that much.	if you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print --n40223a is stuff that you probably knew --n402259 already and the stuff that you want --n40227c they're not printing --n402293 because the average person doesn't need or want --n4022be to know that much, but not both.	if you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print --n40223a is stuff that you probably knew --n402259 already and the stuff that you want --n40227c they're not printing --n402293 because the average person doesn't need and want --n4022be to know that much.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###yeah.###speakerb28t28.###and i think the same thing is true with news.###if you want --n401f69 to just have an idea as to what --n401f90's going on, most papers, a-, and especially the better papers, the, the times, the wall street journal, the washington post give you a reasonable idea.###speakera29t29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30t29.###speakera31t31.###yeah.###speakerb32t32.

169577:50	i think in like, uh, lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever. how ever many --n402ffb is on, sitting on a jury.	i think in like, uh, lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever. how ever many --n402ffb is on, sitting on a jury, but not both.	i think in like, uh, lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve and five out of six, whatever. how ever many --n402ffb is on, sitting on a jury.	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	###speakerb56t56.###uh-huh.###speakera57t57.###well maybe not.###i don't know.###at least in capital cases i'd think they'd have --n402e54 to be unanimous.###speakerb58t58.###i believe it is in capital.###speakera59t58.###speakerb60t60.
169593:30	and, uh, they've only deliberated four hours or, something	and, uh, they've only deliberated four hours or, something, but not both.	and, uh, they've only deliberated four hours and, something	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###uh,###speakera63t63.###yeah.###the paper here tonight had a thing about the noriega trial. and that there's one juror that --n403393 is, is, uh, different than the other eleven.###speakerb64t64.###uh-huh.###speakera65t64.###speakerb66t66.###yeah.###speakera67t67.

169818:51	i mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of --n403b21 later on	i mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of --n403b21 later on, but not both.	i mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids and, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of --n403b21 later on	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###speakera45t45.###oh, wow.###but maybe you shouldn't be held --n403931 responsible for something you did --n403950 several years ago.###speakerb46t46.###so,###speakera47t46.###speakerb48t48.###i know.###speakera49t49.###that's the other thing.
169940:25	there's nothing, maybe a picture or two that --n404022 belongs to that person	there's nothing, maybe a picture or two that --n404022 belongs to that person, but not both.	there's nothing, maybe a picture and two that --n404022 belongs to that person	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	###speakerb33t33.###uh-huh.###so it gives them a sense of identity.###speakera34t34.###and so,###speakerb35t34.###speakera36t36.###yeah,###you walked in there###and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, yo-, you, you walk into some rooms --n403e58 and there's, it's completely generic.
169950:101	i used --n404880 to initially think that the only people who --n4048a7 went into such residences were people who, uh, --n4048d6 were adequately deficient in their abilities, uh physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves.	i used --n404880 to initially think that the only people who --n4048a7 went into such residences were people who, uh, --n4048d6 were adequately deficient in their abilities, uh physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves, but not both.	i used --n404880 to initially think that the only people who --n4048a7 went into such residences were people who, uh, --n4048d6 were adequately deficient in their abilities, uh physical and mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###there's nothing, maybe a picture or two that --n404022 belongs to that person###and that's it.###but this room, on the other hand, you know, they got rid --n404149 of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that###and they had all their stuff from their house###and it looked like, uh, i-, i-, it must have been,###it --n4043f0 was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them###and it must also give them a sense of, uh, uh, security and, and, uh, and, and, you know, s-, s-, uh,###speakerb37t37.###yeah,### i, i think part of what you're saying --n40472d matches what i h-, have read --n404750.
170074:84	and it, that i, i don't know if i ever went as far as three months --n4026cd or not i-, i-, in --n4026fc keeping that kind of data.	and it, that i, i don't know if i ever went as far as three months --n4026cd or not i-, i-, in --n4026fc keeping that kind of data, but not both.	and it, that i, i don't know if i ever went as far as three months --n4026cd and not i-, i-, in --n4026fc keeping that kind of data.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	yes	yes	S	###things would get to tight.###uh, and sometimes what i would do --n402201 is keep a piece of paper in my wallet###and every time i, uh, i spent money, i mean cash mostly --n402327, i would, uh, write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent --n40238a on food so i could do better planning.###speakerb32t32.###uh-huh.###speakera33t32.###speakerb34t34.###uh-huh.###speakera35t35.###but i would forget --n4025e2 to write the things down
170132:31	but for me, i only do that every week or, without even, i mean, maybe once a month.	but for me, i only do that every week or, without even, i mean, maybe once a month, but not both.	but fand me, i only do that every week and, without even, i mean, maybe once a month.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###and it just wouldn't stop.###uh, and it,### i, i just didn't feel the need for a new car.###it isn't like i couldn't afford one.###speakerb50t50.###uh-huh.###speakera51t51.###uh, and now, i mean i, i don't, uh,###i tend --n403ed3 to eat expensive food.###i mean i don't mind --n403f54 buying a good steak
170139:15	so it's six or seven dollars.	so it's six or seven dollars, but not both.	so it's six and seven dollars.	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	###uh, and now, i mean i, i don't, uh,###i tend --n403ed3 to eat expensive food.###i mean i don't mind --n403f54 buying a good steak###but for me, i only do that every week or, without even, i mean, maybe once a month.###speakerb52t51.###speakerb54t54.###yeah.###speakera55t55.###i mean you buy a, a tenderloin steak, it costs outrageous, like twelve dollars a pound.###you buy a, a, less than half a pound
170155:23	do you work for a big --n4000ea or a little --n4000fd place.	do you work for a big --n4000ea or a little --n4000fd place, but not both.	do you wandk fand a big --n4000ea and a little --n4000fd place.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	SQ	###and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food --n40468f, it doesn't add up. if you're buying, i mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants, which i don't care --n40470a to go to --n40471d.###speakerb58t58.###that's right.###speakera59t59.### so, so that's, i think --n40496c, one of the reasons i don't need --n40499b to budget --n4049aa is that i don't have, i don't, i don't have --n4049f9 to hold myself back from --n404a14 buying that expensive thing because i can't afford it, because i'm not interested in that expensive thing.###speakerb60t60.###a lot of,###speakera61t60.###speakera1t1.### wha-, what sort of company do you work for --n40003a.
170249:63	you know. because it --n40294b's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know.	you know. because it --n40294b's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know, but not both.	you know. because it --n40294b's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying and businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	SBAR	###but i mean the company as a whole###because you as an employee,###even the company is making money,###they paying you a salary###but you are responsible for that company growth.###you're responsible --n40258c also for --n40259b helping that company get to the par-, point that it's at --n4025d6 at --n4025e1 making profits.###so there should be something --n402725 in there or some kind of clause that --n40274c will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.###speakera35t35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36t36.

173602:32	you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what, ten or twenty dollars an ounce.	you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what, ten or twenty dollars an ounce, but not both.	you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine fand what, ten and twenty dollars an ounce.	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	###yeah.###you know, they, they support drug habits with, uh, with, uh, you know, with things like, uh, you know, burglary or, or prostitution or stuff like that,###yeah.###speakerb30t30.###oh, yeah.###sure.###well it goes back to that, again, if you look at prohibition.###i mean because it's illegal, it costs more.###if it was legal,###i mean, face it
173668:99	i don't have any, you know, love lost for people who --n4058db are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff.	i don't have any, you know, love lost for people who --n4058db are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff, but not both.	i don't have any, you know, love lost fand people who --n4058db are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job and that kind of stuff.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###i don't think you can.###i mean, you know, i'm, you know, was raised --n4054b5 with being a very strong bible work ethic###so, you know, i'm one of these, you know, ten, twelve, fifteen, twenty hour a day type people.###speakera51t51.###uh-huh.###speakerb52t52.###so, you know, yeah,###i can really relate to###yeah,###everybody ought --n405802 to do their own share, you know.
173701:143	so you're saying that the taxpayer who --n400d13 also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of, uh, real estate or other taxes	so you're saying that the taxpayer who --n400d13 also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of, uh, real estate or other taxes, but not both.	so you're saying that the taxpayer who --n400d13 also is really paying through the pocketbook fand the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition fand that child in the fandm of, uh, real estate and other taxes	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###what --n40063d do you feel that your kids are getting --n400664 in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get --n40068f in a, the public school system.###speakera7t7.###well, one hundred percent of the, uh, customers care.###that's one thing.###everybody cares about the education the kids are getting --n4008ca.###and, uh, they, uh, take an active, relatively active part.### which, uh, i mean if you're, uh, sending two thousand dollars that way every year, you, uh, watch what --n400a7a goes on###and you, uh, uh, pay attention and participate### and, and you can influence the way things are --n400c52.###speakerb8t8.

173724:140	and by definition, for some of us, at least, the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that, uh, you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the, at the local level or bigger votes at the national level.	and by definition, for some of us, at least, the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that, uh, you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the, at the local level or bigger votes at the national level, but not both.	and by definition, fand some of us, at least, the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that, uh, you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the, at the local level and bigger votes at the national level.	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	###uh, people are, uh, reluctant --n401724 to pass, uh, school tax levies even, uh, when the money is needed --n40176f or would be well spent --n40178a because it's, uh, they don't have kids in the schools.###speakerb12t12.###right.###speakera13t13.###i think that's a, a loss of civic virtue and a loss of, uh, uh, the cultural attitude that we used --n4019f4 to have --n401a03 that education was first even if it wasn't our kids.###i think that's, uh, that's the principal problem is that, uh, people no longer see it as, uh, as their problem###and there's an immediate problem.###speakerb14t14.###right.###it --n401dfb troubles me too tha-, that the priority seems --n401e26 to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good
