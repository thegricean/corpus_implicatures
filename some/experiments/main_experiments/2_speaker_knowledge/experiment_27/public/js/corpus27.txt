8884:22	so i guess i get some of both.	###so there's not a whole a lot of time that i've got --n400141, uh, for hobbies it seems like --n400168 lately.###but one of the things that i do --n400281 when i've got some spare time --n4002a4 is i do some woodworking.###and that, oh, i guess, ranges anywhere from, uh, carpentry work to, um, um, some types of furniture and, um, oh, i don't know what you would call them --n400448, knickknacks, i guess, stuff you hang --n400477 on the wall --n40048a to put a mirror on --n4004a5###and i made some, um, candle sconces that you hang --n400701 on the...###.###yeah,###i have quite a few of those that my uncle made --n4007e8.###.###there's something about working with wood that, that i enjoy --n4008a2, that,###i don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make --n4009d1 or the smell of the wood###but,###.###as you know, i think it's more like the mess you make --n400b1d, isn't it.###you don't have --n400c2d to worry about --n400c40 cleaning it up.###.###yeah,###because it's, it's out there.###you know i don't have --n400da0 to worry about --n400db3 getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust --n400dea,###and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that,###but then, i get the opportunity --n400f80 to vacuum,	so i guess i get all of both.
