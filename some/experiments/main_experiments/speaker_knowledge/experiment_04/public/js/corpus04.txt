86489:22	what we did --n40321c in some of the other cities and they tell you --n40324b to do that is to hire a local guide	###.### we, we found that in jamaica. it was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, well try and sell drugs and things like that###.###uh-huh.###.###but they, they were so destitute###and i guess they, they make all their money on tourism### and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want --n402d62 to buy different things###and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,###.###yeah.###.###you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you --n402f81.###.### the, the worst place was in marrakech###.###uh-huh.###.###and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad###and a couple of them it was,	what we did --n40321c in all of the other cities and they tell you --n40324b to do that is to hire a local guide
13424:16	and in fact, some of these things i get --n400e88, some of these questionnaires,	###and almost anything you do --n400743 now, a social security number is required --n40076a.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, of course there's another aspect of this, too, uh, in terms of invasion of privacy###i just thought about it,###-n40098f being a professional and, of course, you probably belong to one or more professional organizations,###and that is that some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which i think --n400ad0 is a, is an invasion of privacy.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###i agree.###.###.###yes,###i get some of these things --n400c8e in the mail that i wonder, where in the world did they get my address --n400cd5 or where did they get my name --n400cf8 --n400cff.###.###uh-huh.###.	and in fact, all of these things i get --n400e88, some of these questionnaires,
91388:33	so you've really, uh, i guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything.	###um,. i think it depends on if you want --n406725 to be a, if you want a regional job or a national job,###you need that first, job or so out of school, too.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.### i, i guess another thing that --n406977 concerns me is, uh, so many people, it seems like everybody today is still in that mumblex job market###and, uh, um, where was i at --n406b64.###oh, go-, in going to school, you get taught --n406bfd the things you learn --n406c18 in school,###but there is also a whole other dimension, i mean the growing up while you're going --n406d69 to school --n406d78 part.###.###uh-huh,###yeah.###.###and, uh, actually, in the midwest especially, a lot of the schools have, like university of missouri, will have a main campus like columbia, which --n406f13 is big, multi disciplinary,###.###right.###.###and they'll have a satellite campus --n4070be in a, usually in a smaller town that --n4070e9 specializes in the technical field.	so you've really, uh, i guess sacrificed all social exposure to different groups and everything.
27808:28	i find it --n403dd7 very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy --n403e02 i particularly like the music.	### i, i've gone through different periods of life, uh, in music from pop to classical.###i guess one of the things was that --n402db6 influenced me was that i, i've worked in radio stations as a d j for all my college years --n402e11 trying --n402e1c to support my way through there, and suppor-, was support,###i was influenced --n40304e by all different kinds of music but basically because that's where i worked --n40308d.###and i've developed a real love for, uh, classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, uh, heavy into classical type music.###he said he used --n4032f4 to sit on saturday mornings and watch cartoons just --n40331f to hear the music, uh, that they were using --n403352 behind them because they used, especially disney used --n40337d a lot of classical music, uh, behind the cartoons###and so consequently we wind up, wound up --n403599 playing a lot of classical music there###and i think that, uh, got deep seated into me.###one of things i especially like --n40373c now in music regardless of what kind it is --n403767, uh, are those that --n403786 call on those classical, uh, roots, i guess --n4037bd,###uh, barry manilow comes to mind###for some reason there's, there's not a whole lot of his stuff that i'm real crazy about --n4039e2,###but he does have some things.###chicago had some things,###.###right.###.###uh, and i think even electric light orchestra had some, some real, um, influences by classical music###and i'm still, still,###my favorite,###in fact most of my c d --s are classical music.###.	i find it --n403dd7 very interesting that all television shows that i enjoy --n403e02 i particularly like the music.
55028:10	uh, some of them didn't	###.###i guess you keep those things you grew up with --n400c3b.###i worked in, uh, missouri for a while###and, uh, i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on t v --n400db4 when the cowboys were playing the saint louis cardinals --n400ddf###and i was rooting for the cowboys.###.###yeah.###.###but, they were kind of closer to home when, when i struck up with them --n400fba.###i really don't know what --n4010a3's going --n4010b2 to take place with the cowboys this year.###everybody keeps --n401196 talking about the reconstruction they're going through --n4011c1 and new players and how next year is going --n4011ec to be even bigger and better than the previous year --n40121b.###in a way that happened this past season,###and i think that's quite a bit of optimism --n4013f6 around here that still there's a chance that maybe, uh, these guys are right, maybe they will come through and, and do something this year.###i look for it to be a pretty good year.###.###boy they, uh, they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago.###.###they did,###uh, they got rid --n4017ee of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names --n401825 in that we weren't, weren't familiar with --n401854.###some of them turned out --n40199f to be pretty good players,	uh, all of them didn't
15261:29	i think that maybe that's why some people do it --n402b3c is, uh, to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that.	###.###i have this thing against bugs, too.###and seems to me like the peace corps, they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs --n402514 mumblex.###.###yeah,###africa.###.###yeah,### have --n40265a to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything.###i'd probably catch a terrible disease and die.###.###yeah,###well. i doubt that,###but, you know how it is --n402834 mumblex.###.###.### w-, i, i mean, it would, it --n4028db would have --n4028ea to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture --n402925, usually, i guess --n402944.###.###yeah.###.	i think that maybe that's why all people do it --n402b3c is, uh, to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that.
7100:11	well, and some people use one credit card --n403883 to pay for another credit card they own --n4038ae,	###well, it --n4032ee's interesting, uh, that, uh, people have the, generally the same view. of credit cards, no matter where you go --n403361.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###and, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, i didn't realize i had this much, you know, i'd spent this much money.###.###that much stuff.###.###.###right.###.###and, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it.###.	well, and all people use one credit card --n403883 to pay for another credit card they own --n4038ae,
90848:29	and it was not only in mississippi, in some other places, as well,	###all local.###were they like all in dallas.###.###uh, no, no not, no,###this was, well,###i am actually from mississippi,###and, so that's,###.###oh.###.### it, it was around there generally.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###uh, that's where the family grew --n4008f1.###.###just from city to city then mumblex.###.###yeah,	and it was not only in mississippi, in all other places, as well,
