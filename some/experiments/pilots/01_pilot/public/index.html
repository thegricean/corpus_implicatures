    <p id="instruct-text" align="left">You will read 20 short conversations. These are transcriptions of real conversations that real people had over the phone. The last sentence of each conversation will be marked in red. <strong>Your task is to rate what the person who said the red sentence knows.</strong><br>The HIT will take approximately 6 minutes. Let's start with five examples!</p>

Sometimes, the sentence with "all" will sound strange. In this case, set the slider to the best of your ability, but also click the checkbox next to "The blue sentence sounds strange".
