53:48	and, um, she had used the walker for, for quite some time, probably about six to nine months.	###yeah.###.###fortunately, she only had --n4012e0 to stay a few weeks###and she was able --n40136e to, to return to her apartment again.###but it's really a big, uh, big, uh, decision as to, you know, when to do it --n4014a2.###.###yeah.###.###you know, is there something else we could have done --n401608, you know, in --n401623 checking out all the places that, uh, --n40164e might be available.###of course, you know, there's not one on every corner, especially, you know, smaller areas, smaller towns.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###yeah.###probably the hardest thing in, in my family, uh, my grandmother, she had --n40197f to be put --n401992 in a nursing home
362:44	that's just a matter of defining priorities, i guess or some priorities anyway.	###sure.###.###.###realistically it is.###.###and i, i think, i think that we may not, that may be, you know, perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may, that may choose --n407b1f to alleviate a lot of the problem.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###that would, certainly help.###.###i mean, i mean we may not, we may not have as high a standard of living###.###.###uh-huh.###.### but the qua-, but actually have a truer standard of living.###.###right.
456:25	um, but still, it gives it some variety.	###.###so, i predominantly wear flat shoes.###um, you know, in the winter i wear sweaters,###in summer i, you know, i like one piece dresses, short sleeves, things like that.###.###i've recently, um, tried --n400e84 to update my wardrobe, --n400e9f trying --n400eaa to put suits --n400ebd together that i can interchange, --n400edc the, jackets and the blouses and all that a lot.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###that's helped me a lot with having,###i can only have a, a limited wardrobe, since i'm only, working part-time right now.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
869:117	i think in a good example on the typical thing that --n4009a7 happens, uh, when the phone rang --n4009ce and it's t i --n4009ed calling, my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message	###.###but it says when the conversation is over --n4054b2 just say your good-byes and hang up.###so, i, i guess so.###.###why don't we do that --n405623.###.###okay.###.###good-bye sharon.###.###good talking to you archie.###.###.###well, the first thing for me is i wonder, i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is --n400076,###um, if privacy is something that --n4001ba disturbs your private state, i mean an invasion of privacy is something that --n4001f9 disturbs your private state, that's one thing,###and if privacy is something that --n40039f comes into your private state and extracts information from it, in other words, finds something --n4003ea out about you that's another.###and the first kind of invasion of, the first type of privacy seemed --n40056b invaded --n400576 to me, and very much everyday in this country,###but in the second time, at least overtly, uh, where someone comes in and, uh, finds out information about you that --n400716 should be private --n400729, uh, does not seem, uh, um, obviously, everyday.###.### i, i think i agree with that.
905:41	and you, one's feeling obligated, because of some sense of, of the way the ritual is played --n401dcc out --n401dd7.	###exactly.###uh, and at the same time i think that i receive on, on the order of, uh, probably, seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way --n401185 to just hang up on it --n4011a4 --n4011ab.###.### from, from personal parties or from these, um, phone answer, phone, uh, commercial things.###.###commercial, sol-, solicitations primarily.###.###.###oh, that, that's a remarkable number.###i get them rarely###and i'm still astounded that, that one, they let anyone do them and two, that they have any effect in this whatsoever.###um, because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what, they are --n4017a7.###.###yeah.###.###i think they prey on people's, um, inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine.###i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has --n401a07 --n401a12 to say --n401a21,###and then they feel an obligation --n401b3d to respond even though there's not even a person there.###.###and i think that's what --n401c2f makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems --n401c5e to be little control
1122:23	because anyone can be alone for some period of time	### tha-, that is true.###i haven't thought about that### and, and that it --n407b27's fascinating to, to think a lot of someone who --n407b5e doesn't know how --n407b75 to say private --n407b88.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###and that's really, um,###well, i mean, i, i wonder how people have sex --n407dad, and things like that,###.###.###i mean, they a-,,###you go to india###and it's obvious, you know, the results of sex are quite obvious,, as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years.###um, but i, i just don't quite, um,###there's hope,###i actually###for al-, of the time i've spent --n408226 there, i still don't quite understand how certain things that i assume --n408269 and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy --n4082c0.###.###yes.###.
1149:15	or they're introducing some new product in the area	###.###that's interesting.### are th-, are there any other specific things that, that you feel like, where, where you feel your privacy to be invaded --n408a11 on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency --n408a40.###.###all the class-, the other classic examples, the jehovah's witness or, or mormons or someone knocking at the front door, um, which --n408c86 is more intrusive because i have --n408ca5 to really tell someone --n408cbc to go away.###and there's that sense of, i have now opened my door###they now see what i look like --n408f30, what i live like --n408f4b### and nor-, and they're doing something that normally i really only invite, people to --n409038.###.###okay.###.###because i, any, anyone, any friend, anyone i give my number to --n40918b is welcome --n40919a to call me,###but no one is just welcome --n40930d to come by my house.###so that is more of a sense of invasion.###.###so, that's another example of the invasion because of the not so...###.###.###have you ever gotten one of those calls that --n400036 is either generated --n400049 by a computer or somebody going down a list###and they're either offering a service
1177:17	i've even had some of them,	###.###that was the big one i'm talking about --n400555.###i work weird hours,###and invariably just about the time, i'm going --n400645 to sleep --n400654, the phone tears off the wall.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###and you are trying --n400782 to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone,### you either hear, the cli-, as soon as you say hello, you hear the click of the recording coming on,###.###uh-huh.###.###or you hear somebody all ready starting, reading off a list of stuff that they've read --n400a08 probably a thousand times that day already.###.###that's true,###or the ones that --n400b78 are, are generated --n400b8f by a computer.###it's just a computer voice that --n400c61 comes on the line.###those are the ones that i really, really hate --n400d1f too.###.
1206:10	and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand --n401aa7.	###and i go through them###and most of them aren't from anybody at all.###.###what i would love --n401258 to see --n401267 done to stop all of this,###.###uh-huh.###.###we've got a thing in this country,###you can have your phone number unlisted,###.###uh-huh.###.###and i think a law should be passed --n40147b to where any of these people,###i think it --n401557's great, that you know, freedom of speech in this country and everything,###but if they're going --n40168b to offer these services, or these recorded message, everything, they ought --n4016ca to be stuck --n4016dd working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer --n40171c to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them.###.###uh-huh,###yes,###see i have an unlisted telephone number,###but i still get all of those calls
1214:19	i put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door, either religious groups, or people peddling products.	###you can have your phone number unlisted,###.###uh-huh.###.###and i think a law should be passed --n40147b to where any of these people,###i think it --n401557's great, that you know, freedom of speech in this country and everything,###but if they're going --n40168b to offer these services, or these recorded message, everything, they ought --n4016ca to be stuck --n4016dd working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer --n40171c to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them.###.###uh-huh,###yes,###see i have an unlisted telephone number,###but i still get all of those calls###and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand --n401aa7.###so, yeah,###i do,###i really feel that's, uh, an invasion of my privacy.###i agree with you on that particular subject there.### let me see.###.###that's about, that as far as any other everyday occurrences,
1282:24	i wonder if there would be some way we could get these people to do this get their names, their addresses, and their phone numbers and then reverse it, and do --n4049dd,	###and i've put, in,###i don't know how much clearer it can be --n40413c,###it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting.### i should have, i guess i should make another one that --n40427d says religious or otherwise, cause i still get,###.###yeah,###yeah,###that's true,###yeah.###no### i don't, uh, i don't have, i didn't go that far###but, uh, yeah###i probably could do the same thing, uh, you know,###i don't have a storm door,###but i'm sure i could rig up something.###but you know i don't think that that would stop people.### i, it's like they see that word###and it says go, instead of stop.###oh, goodness.###.
1638:23	i think there is still some discrimination there where as, you know, men and women work in the same job --n40581d,	###uh-huh,###i guess i take it for granted, kind of, because, i just,###it's always been that way.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i know,###.###yeah,###but i can rem-, remember back growing up, my mother,###i mean it was###she always worked,###but it --n405479 wasn't that easy for her to just take off.###.###oh no,###i can remember my mother getting in trouble if, you know, one of was sick,###and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything, you know, compared to the work that she did --n4056ab.###.###oh yeah.###.
1686:32	and, uh, quite honestly, i, i have some little children	###i sure will.###bye-bye.###.###okay,###bye-bye.###.###.###hi.###.###hi,###um, okay### what, now, uh, what particularly, particularly what kind of music do you like --n4000c3.###.###well, i mostly listen to popular music.###i, uh, listen to it all the time in, in my car,###so, i, i tend --n400309 to be one of those people who --n40032c switches stations a lot because i don't like commercials.###but, uh, i find myself listening to popular music,###.###yeah.###.
1843:22	i mean i've heard some songs that, that i just thought --n4043ac were horrendous cover versions of,	###.###and, he, he since then has, has amended that, and paid them his royalties every time the, the song goes on --n403af9###but,###.###yeah.###i don't know### it may have, it may have been somebody else, because i think, i think that even jimi hendrix did it,###i think that was a cov-,###you know, come --n403ecb to think of it, i think that was a cover version of, like a john lee hooker song, or something,###.###maybe so.### i, i, can't think.###.###i mean it was just like,###it was really old.###.###.###i mean i, i,### there are a lot, there are so many different songs,###i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times.
1939:10	i saw some promise, you know, with, with a lot of the new wave, when it, when it came out, uh, back in the mid and early eighties --n406569.	###no.###.###i mean, the comparison made between new kids on the block with the beatles. it was just,###.###you can only laugh.###.###yeah,###you just sort of,###you know, well i guess i can just humor them, you know. at this point.###.###right###well, they,###i guess our age is showing when, we, we think that --n406222.###.###yeah,###but well, you know, i, i, i've liked a lot of the new music.###i think, um, um, when###.###uh-huh.###.
1986:25	because, i mean, there are some	###.###well, world music is, um,### a lot of the, a lot of where they, where they make music that they adapt --n40727e to a, to another kind of, to another type of listener --n4072c5.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, for example, let's say you're taking like an original brazilian form of music and, with a certain style,###and then you try --n40762a to make it a little bit more listenable for, let's say --n407669 another audience, let's say --n40768c a north american.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, then when they hear it --n407805, it, it's a really, it's another form of music,###and, you know, sort of, um, trying --n407986 to draw out the best sources.###.###um.###.### the, the best of every type of music.###.###right.###.
1988:12	there are some, you know, types of heavy metal that i really like --n407c64,	### a lot of the, a lot of where they, where they make music that they adapt --n40727e to a, to another kind of, to another type of listener --n4072c5.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, for example, let's say you're taking like an original brazilian form of music and, with a certain style,###and then you try --n40762a to make it a little bit more listenable for, let's say --n407669 another audience, let's say --n40768c a north american.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, then when they hear it --n407805, it, it's a really, it's another form of music,###and, you know, sort of, um, trying --n407986 to draw out the best sources.###.###um.###.### the, the best of every type of music.###.###right.###.###because, i mean, there are some##, i mean, i, i li-,
2006:5	some of it,	###because, i mean, there are some##, i mean, i, i li-,###there are some, you know, types of heavy metal that i really like --n407c64,### but, but i wouldn't, i wouldn't say that i, i completely like heavy metal.###.###no.###.### i, i think, you know,###and it's the same way with, you know,###world music takes the forms that --n407fd3 have really been, um, i guess, i you know, the best example or, you know, the cream of the crop, i guess you could say,### and then, and then taking those, those qualities, and then applying, in the styles, that --n40827f are really, um, that --n40829e are extremely enjoyable, and then taking,###.###so then it becomes a kind of music of, of its own, so to speak,###or, uh,###.###yeah,###yeah,###it becomes a kind of music of its own.###i mean, when you listen to it --n40866f, it's um, uh,###i think that they don't use, elec-,
2100:38	um, it takes some, it --n4015d6 takes some dedication to do it,	###a running total.###.###.###yeah.###.###what do you all do --n400b65.###.###uh, we've, we've, uh, taken how much we have --n400bf7, you know, write down how much we have --n400c26 coming in each month###and then, uh, we've,###at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend --n400e2d.###we sat dow-, made up different accounts like, you know,###we've set a budget for each, you know, household expenses, or food, and clothing and entertainment and then our, our own fun money and just stuff like that###and then we write down each, each time we spend something --n401189, we write down in a book###and at the end of the month we tally it up --n4012bc to see how close we, you know### we, we try --n4013bd to stay within a certain budget,###so.###.### is it, is it --n401499 hard to keep track of it###or does it work out pretty well.###.
2180:39	so we have, both of us have some money in an i r a that we're also trying --n40381f to figure --n40382e,	###.###uh-huh.###.###so, we don't have any long term, you know, in stocks, or anything like that right now,###so.###.###yeah,###mostly what we're doing, we've worked, we've done --n403075 the, uh, coda account with t i where they, we put in so much a month --n4030c8,### and then they,###or so much a pay check###and then they match it.###.###yeah,###that's what we're doing --n40338c.###.###so that's, that's worked out pretty good###and then, i used --n4034a8 to work for t i###and i have,###when i retired from there, or left --n40357e, i took the money i that i had --n4035ad in mine and put it in an i r a###and we had an out, we had an existing i r a
2199:135	and they did an analysis --n40444a for us based on what we were putting --n404471 in and the time frame that we wanted --n404498 to look at --n4044ab, and then gave us a good idea back, you know, some good information --n4044fa back on whether or not we were going --n404525 to achieve those goals, and, or not, and what we needed --n404564 to do --n404573 so that we could achieve them and the money we could put --n4045ae in at what time.	###and we had an out, we had an existing i r a###so we have, both of us have some money in an i r a that we're also trying --n40381f to figure --n40382e,### to, put it, we're putting it in c d's right now,###.###uh-huh.###.###and then we're also looking at it in --n403a75 possibly getting a mutual fund.###.###yeah,###when ever we get enough saved --n403b54 we stick it in a c d for a while### and, then, uh, you know and then when, if we need it we wait until it, it's expired### and then so,###.###yeah.###the other thing that we've done --n403e67, that, that --n403e7e was really nice to see --n403ea1, we had one of the financial companies, um,### han-, uh, john hancock company came out###and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and, uh, what we were pla-, what, what our, uh, goals were --n404121 on a long term budget in terms of retirement, kids college, paying off the house, buying a different house, um, special thing, buying land and building our own house###.###uh-huh.###.
2335:27	well, uh, maybe i am into some things --n402ab3 occasionally that i don't think of --n402ad6 in terms of self improvement.	###.###yeah.###.###uh, one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who --n402297 is.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is --n402405###and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.###you're my customer, i'm your customer, sort of thing.###.###right.###.###um, every now and then i'm loaned --n402668 a tape i can stick --n402687 in the, uh, in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of pat hagerty and these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type. which --n40276a all, you know, betters yourself.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###yeah,
2345:21	i, uh, have attended some seminars that --n402d8c had some tapes that --n402da3 went with them, but, uh, i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things,	###.###right.###.###um, every now and then i'm loaned --n402668 a tape i can stick --n402687 in the, uh, in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of pat hagerty and these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type. which --n40276a all, you know, betters yourself.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###yeah,###well, uh, maybe i am into some things --n402ab3 occasionally that i don't think of --n402ad6 in terms of self improvement.###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean they are###but i don't label it as such.###.###like what for example.###.###well, i don't know, um,
2345:39	i, uh, have attended some seminars that --n402d8c had some tapes that --n402da3 went with them, but, uh, i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things,	###.###right.###.###um, every now and then i'm loaned --n402668 a tape i can stick --n402687 in the, uh, in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of pat hagerty and these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type. which --n40276a all, you know, betters yourself.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###yeah,###well, uh, maybe i am into some things --n402ab3 occasionally that i don't think of --n402ad6 in terms of self improvement.###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean they are###but i don't label it as such.###.###like what for example.###.###well, i don't know, um,
2400:27	you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other	###.###i don't know,###i'm not sure i could take too much of stephen king.###that's a little, little heavy for me.###.###yeah,### they're, uh, quite, uh, they're hard to set --n40439b down because it's so interesting###and, of course, they're all just a little spookier than the movies,###but, uh, it's always, they're always challenging to get through --n4045ac one of them.###.###yeah.###.###i have a hard time finishing books.###.###well i guess i also have been reading, uh, a lot of things on, uh, quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what i'm involved in --n4047d7 a lot at work.###.###uh-huh.###in quality, especially now days, uh, that's almost everything that --n4049af comes across the, the, the airways mumblex.###.###oh, yeah,

2582:17	well i've seen some people try --n4042ff to just come in like over the weekend because they want --n404332 to use the texteller machine.	###you know, i mean, mumblex as far as i'm considered --n403a84, she was in violation###and nobody says anything to them.###it's always been a big problem in lewisville in the summertime.###.###um.###.###you know, if they just, you know,###the management doesn't ever seem --n403d30 to want --n403d3f to take an, cut off, you know, that no, this is wear we're going --n403d92 to draw the line --n403da9.###this is shorts, you know.###.###yeah.###.### and, and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that, you know,###.###um.###.###so, it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going, well god, we have a pair of those at home too.###it --n4041f7 sure would be cool and comfortable to wear, you know,###but.###.

2767:14	i've done some of the other speech programs,	###or it would me, you know.###.###it's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here.###.###yeah,###yeah,### look at this slick guy,###i wonder what kind of money does he make --n409055,###uh-huh.###.###.###i can see it now.###well it --n409145 was good to talk to you.###it was really enjoyable.###.###yeah,### this is, this is kind of a fun project.###.###it really is.###.
3029:19	i've known jack for some time.	###so, uh, is there any,###i'm not sure how long we're supposed --n403cad to talk --n403cbc.###.### it's, um, it's just as long as you want --n403d85 to.###.###oh. o-,###.###i mean it's just, uh, as long as you want --n403ec6 to, and just, you know, a reasonable lengthy conversation.###uh, do you work for texas instruments.###.###no,###i do not.###i work for g t e.###.###oh, okay.###.###and, i, uh, of course, was, i was sent --n40419a a, uh, an application from, uh, from jack.###.###uh-huh.###.
3209:48	so, so then we got, we got some same things because,	###.###yeah,###that's cool.###.###right.###.###and, how about the rolling stones.###.###oh, sure,###sure###i went to their concert last year when they were here --n400900.###.###oh, that's when, that's when they took, toured --n4009c6.###how about, um, pink floyd.###.###sure,###yeah,###i like them.###.###okay.
3226:17	like, give me some examples.	###i like them.###.###okay.### so, so then we got, we got some same things because,###.###okay,###well, i just didn't know that much about music###and i wasn't sure what kind of music.###.###no,###it's very hard###because, see, well, i mean, in the whole spectrum i'd rather listen, you know,###i listen to heavy metal or classic rock.###.### what, what kind of heavy metal are we talking about --n400fa6.###what,###.###we're talking about what they, what they call --n401087 hard rock.###.###okay,
3297:34	that's, that's what some people call like --n4025d2 really heavy metal.	###.###and they just bump into each other,###.###uh-huh.###.### like, like they hit each other with their shoulders,###.###uh-huh.###.###and, then, you knock people down,###and what you do --n40223b is, you also try --n40225a to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people.###.###is that the kind of music that you like --n4023c7.###.###no,###i don't like that music.###.###oh, okay.###.###but, that's, that's what they do --n40250c.
3372:16	they came up with some pretty weird stuff after that.	###yeah,###yeah.###.###yeah,### that, that was great.###i heard that the other day on the radio###and i pumped it up.###.###.###because, i mean, i just love that song.###.###yeah,### that, that was a real good one.###.###yeah,###but they had,### that, that whole record was pretty good.###but then, they started --n403829 going downhill like everybody else.###.###well, that's true.
3798:43	and, uh, there's, uh, there's some petting, you know, like, uh, uh,	###.###oh, yeah,###we,###i guess there's science place one and science place two.###we've only been in, i think it's --n402e80 science place two.###.### i, is, i'm not sure which one we went into --n402f61,###it was about a year or so ago, when we went --n403044.###.###the one we went in --n4030e5 had, uh,###the thing that --n40317b sticks out most in my mind is that, like a kid's place area.###.###uh-huh,###yeah.###.### that really seem, they really seemed --n4032db to go wild in there.###.###yeah,###yeah###they had a lot of fun in there
3878:16	well i've gotten some good ideas from you.	###and then all the, the, the rides are free.###you know, of course, they have all the little video games and, you know, those little quarter rides, you know, --n40481e to, and stuff like that###but, they thought that was lot of fun.###.###yeah.###.###you can have birthday parties there###an, i think that was better than like showbiz pizza cause there's more for them to do --n404ac0.###.###because they can just do,###you don't have --n404c1a to have tokens for everything.###.###yeah,###right.###.###yeah.###.###so they had a lot of fun.###.###that does sound like fun.
4008:21	he did, well, in some of the later movies	###i used --n4011fc to like him too,###he was my hero.###in fact, i like sean connery to this day.###.###well, they're showing uh, live and let die at this moment,###.###yeah.###.###and, it is the first appearance of roger moore as double oh seven.###.###yeah.###.###so,###.###oh, he can never cut it.###.###no,###no###that's true.###i was just thinking that today,
4457:24	so, there must be something to some of them.	###so, it's the, it's, it's the, the act-, well it's actually,###it's interesting, because there are re-, real regional differences.###um, in california there's, uh, almost an assumption, um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation --n403b8b, or something, you know, in your sixties, or something like that,###.###.### i'm, i'm, i'm not.###uh, there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness, and, and, at least in urban california.###and, maybe not,###i don't know about rural california too well.###but, in urban california it's just, you know,###for all i know --n4040ac aerobics started out here.###i don't know where they actually started --n404162,###but they, you know, the craze really picked up big here###and before that there was the running craze.###and, they,###california gets, you know, tends --n404354 to be a bit faddish,###but, the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere --n40444c.###.###uh-huh.###.
4489:44	and, uh, so it's had that orientation for quite some time.	###.###and, i,###it's curious, i don't know why, don't know if it's,###do you,###does california have a,###.###well, there's a sense of it being a package,###.###.###i think. there, there is a sense of, you know, whole,###there's a lot of, you know,###you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or whatever.###and, uh, oh the, the, the uni-, university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter. which --n404f25 is, uh, turned into a fairly well subscribed to, uh, newsletter, monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and, it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything.### it, it's on fairly so-, solid scientific ground.###uh, it's just dispensed --n405384 with these distinctions.###it says ever-, all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another --n405470, so that they, they combined them all together.
4490:19	um, there's been some progressive medical schools --n40572e out here, that --n405745 have taken that approach.	###and, i,###it's curious, i don't know why, don't know if it's,###do you,###does california have a,###.###well, there's a sense of it being a package,###.###.###i think. there, there is a sense of, you know, whole,###there's a lot of, you know,###you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or whatever.###and, uh, oh the, the, the uni-, university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter. which --n404f25 is, uh, turned into a fairly well subscribed to, uh, newsletter, monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and, it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything.### it, it's on fairly so-, solid scientific ground.###uh, it's just dispensed --n405384 with these distinctions.###it says ever-, all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another --n405470, so that they, they combined them all together.### and, uh, so it's had that orientation for quite some time.
4528:7	and some of them fizzled out	###.###yeah,###the more money they put --n405f66 into it.###.###yeah.###and,###.###i can see that.###and, cause, i,###knowing###from institutes of learning like that, i know that they've got --n4060ef to get their money somewhere,###and somebody's got --n4061e4 to be willing to pay for it, and believe in it,###so,###.###yeah,###yeah.###exactly.###and, part of it is california, you know, in, back in the sixties, had a lot of alternative movements###.###.
4529:7	and some of them were disastrous	###yeah,###the more money they put --n405f66 into it.###.###yeah.###and,###.###i can see that.###and, cause, i,###knowing###from institutes of learning like that, i know that they've got --n4060ef to get their money somewhere,###and somebody's got --n4061e4 to be willing to pay for it, and believe in it,###so,###.###yeah,###yeah.###exactly.###and, part of it is california, you know, in, back in the sixties, had a lot of alternative movements###.###.###and some of them fizzled out
4591:50	but they, you know, they live to a hundred and ten some, you know,	###.###.###yeah,###well i, i think so.###.###as a fit person.###.###i mean you, you've,### if you look at cert-, if you look at other cultures,###like i know a little bit about people who --n407dc1 were considered --n407dd0 very healthy in china###and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all.###but, they do a lot of low keyed, low impact, low stress exercise,###and they combine it with a, you know, meditation or whatever. some sort of relaxation###.###uh-huh.###.###and, they seem pretty, you know,###they don't have the hard body.###they don't have that perfect look,###and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious.
4795:25	you know, i mean, some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions.	###.###.###huh-uh.###.###if someone is known --n4018f2 to have been in prison, they can't get a job.###.###no.###.###you know.###.###yeah.###.###they can't be accepted --n401a44 into society.###you know, if they're not going --n401ac8 to be accepted --n401adb into society, then everybody's going --n401afe to become sociopathic.###.###huh-uh.###.###and, you know, who --n401c3a's --n401c45 to put the limit on it.###i mean, i was watching a thing last night, up in washington state.###if you get convicted --n401dd2 of, uh, sexual offenses, on a regular basis.
4836:19	at least they might get some benefit in that,	###hey, people make mistakes.###.###yeah,### to go ahead and let them go,###but if they do it again and they really need --n40272f to face the consequences then, uh.###.###well, yeah,### use that###or, you know, there's other consequences rather than killing them, you know,###you could, always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against --n4029a6.###.###oh.###.###.###huh-uh.###.###you know.###.###yeah.###.
4837:47	and if the people they committed a crime against --n402b93, feel, at some later date, that these people have learned their lesson, are, are okay, you know, well, they can free them.	###.###yeah,### to go ahead and let them go,###but if they do it again and they really need --n40272f to face the consequences then, uh.###.###well, yeah,### use that###or, you know, there's other consequences rather than killing them, you know,###you could, always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against --n4029a6.###.###oh.###.###.###huh-uh.###.###you know.###.###yeah.###.###at least they might get some benefit in that,
5001:23	they made a position for them some where.	###.###now, you know, people get fired --n405ae8,###or what --n405b5b's even worse, is they promote them into a position that they can't handle --n405ba6 and let them get fired --n405bc1.###.###yeah.###.###or, one thing or the other.###you look at another kind of society like the japanese.###you put that many people on that small of a space, they've learned --n405e15 to live together.###okay.###it's in their culture.###.###huh-uh.###.###and one of the things that --n405f7a's in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to --n405fc1, is the fact that, while japan was becoming a great power, financially, the people that --n406014 worked for those companies, worked for the same company they worked for --n406053 at sixty-five, as they did when they were eighteen --n406082.###.###teen.###.###and the company, took it upon itself to find a position for these people.###if they weren't fit for the job they were hired --n40642f for, they didn't just can them,
5140:15	and that does take some time.	###yeah,###there's lots of pinks and greens.###.###pinks and greens.###yeah.###.###there's lots of shades of greens.###but the colors,###i just love all the different colors.###.###yeah.###.###they had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to --n401e91.###but, you don't have much spare time either.###.###well, not lately.###i just started a new job###and trying to get acclimated there.###.###oh, yes.
5156:27	i've been trying --n40246a to do some bibs for him. and, uh, work on his christmas stocking.	###i just started a new job###and trying to get acclimated there.###.###oh, yes.###and that does take some time.###and if we're trying --n402143 to get acclimated with the, uh, with having a baby,###and mumblex.###.###yeah.###how old.###.###he's seven months old.###.###oh, yeah.###.###and just into everything,###so there's not a spare moment.###.###.###oh, but i wouldn't trade it for the world.
5366:34	uh, we had some, uh, some people from our church --n401218 went to israel, uh, just for a, uh, tour sort of thing.	###.###yeah.###.###that's the only thing they broadcast --n400c40###and like you i listened to radio on my job at work.###.###uh-huh.###.###and all this week they have been having this, uh, a discussion about that is why, uh, why c n n was###well, i listen to a christian radio station.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they were saying that c n n is definitely a world, uh, news service###and, uh, they,###it was,###you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got --n4010f8, you know.###.###huh.###.
5480:20	but, uh, i know some people at t i,	###.###what part of california are you from --n40305d.###.###uh, from los angeles,###but i live in raleigh, north carolina, right now,###that's where i am speaking to you from --n4031b5.###.###oh, okay.###.###but, i grew up in l a.###i work out here.###.###huh, you work for t i.###.###no,###i don't.###i work for north carolina state university.###.###huh.###.
6395:54	well, you know, t i, you know, t i offers some good stuff	###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###exactly.###.###and, then her little brother's only two years behind###.###exactly.###.###and he says, well, i don't know,###i think that i probably want --n406213 to be a veterinarian.###and i said, that's great.### let me explain to you how you get scholarships, to do that --n40634a.###.###that's right,###.###.###that's right.
6396:60	and then i think there's, i mean i think there's some negatives,	###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###exactly.###.###and, then her little brother's only two years behind###.###exactly.###.###and he says, well, i don't know,###i think that i probably want --n406213 to be a veterinarian.###and i said, that's great.### let me explain to you how you get scholarships, to do that --n40634a.###.###that's right,###.###.###that's right.###well, you know, t i, you know, t i offers some good stuff
6397:25	but there's going --n40669f to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go --n4066de.	###.###.###yeah.###exactly.###.###and, then her little brother's only two years behind###.###exactly.###.###and he says, well, i don't know,###i think that i probably want --n406213 to be a veterinarian.###and i said, that's great.### let me explain to you how you get scholarships, to do that --n40634a.###.###that's right,###.###.###that's right.###well, you know, t i, you know, t i offers some good stuff###and then i think there's, i mean i think there's some negatives,
6414:31	uh, i can see some, some potential changes that --n406feb probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. such as offering a, a smorgasbord. having a larger variety of benefits	###that's right.###well, you know, t i, you know, t i offers some good stuff###and then i think there's, i mean i think there's some negatives,###but there's going --n40669f to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go --n4066de.###i have, you know, all,###this is the first really large company i've worked for --n406854.###i've always been involved in little small, you know, ind-, privately owned s-, owned firms###and so i've never had the, the big benefit package.###so, i really don't know how to compare it to other big companies --n406b03, you know.### it, when i came on --n406bf5 it was great because i had never had anything even close to what, what they offered --n406c40.###so, i've been real pleased.###.###well, that's fantastic,###.###yeah.###.###and on whole o-, i would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors.###.### think so.###.
6581:42	but i guess, they, you could put some money --n401dc0 aside while you were there, your expenses and,	###i was too.###.###.###i thought seriously about joining at that time,###i thought it was a fantastic idea.###.###did you ever get any information on it like,###.###i sent off for stuff on it,###but i don't remember that much. about it.###i know that they trained you in the language###and, um,###.###that's what i was wondering about --n401bdd was whether they actually,###.###you actually got paid --n401c9f too, while in the peace corps,###it wasn't much,###.###yeah.###.
6591:158	but it --n402021 might be interesting to see what --n402044 would happen if you took kids at a, and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed --n4020a3 to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here, and take them to some other country that --n4020fa had different moral values, like saudi arabia where they couldn't drink --n402135.	###i know that they trained you in the language###and, um,###.###that's what i was wondering about --n401bdd was whether they actually,###.###you actually got paid --n401c9f too, while in the peace corps,###it wasn't much,###.###yeah.###.###but i guess, they, you could put some money --n401dc0 aside while you were there, your expenses and,###.###wasn't jimmy carter's mama that --n401ef7 was in the peace corps.###.###yeah,###i think so,###yeah,###yeah.###.###.
6607:30	because from what i understand --n40290d, from some of the guys i know --n402938, you know, crime, uh, is punishable, just almost, uh, instantly and public,	###yeah,###yeah.###.###.###but it --n402021 might be interesting to see what --n402044 would happen if you took kids at a, and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed --n4020a3 to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here, and take them to some other country that --n4020fa had different moral values, like saudi arabia where they couldn't drink --n402135.###.###where they couldn't do that --n4023d1.###yeah,###you might end up with a revolution.###i don't know which end though.###.###really.###.###yeah,###yeah.### that's, that's been interesting, though, the kids that --n402590 have been over, you know, coming back right now, you know.###.###yeah.###.###you wonder if being exposed to that for a while, what percentage of them --n402759 would actually say, hey, that's not a bad way to do it --n4027a4,
6625:192	i, i, i guess, in my own, having had the whole three or four minutes to, you know, give it a great deal of thought --n4031a8, you know, um, i, i think i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary,	###.###you wonder if being exposed to that for a while, what percentage of them --n402759 would actually say, hey, that's not a bad way to do it --n4027a4,###because from what i understand --n40290d, from some of the guys i know --n402938, you know, crime, uh, is punishable, just almost, uh, instantly and public,###.###public hanging.###.###yeah.###public hanging and this sort of thing, you know,###so you don't have just a whole lot of, what we consider --n402bcf street crimes.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###i've heard that like in china and stuff, there is virtually no such thing as rape, because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered --n402d22, you know, on the, you know, street###so,###.###yeah.###well, i guess that's, uh, the price of freedom, i guess, is a little, anyway,### the, uh, uh, the, the public service thing again
6686:28	it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have --n404402 here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled --n404439 that way.	###.###i know my dad always talked about, uh,###he was in c c c during, uh,###.###yeah.###.###and he was, uh, a rock rib iowa type republican###and the only good thing he could ever say --n403fb3 about, uh, the whole roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,###.###huh-uh.###.###because he was in it.###he thought that was great.###.###yeah.###.###the rest of it was all hog wash,###but that was great.###.###well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.
6686:61	it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have --n404402 here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled --n404439 that way.	###.###i know my dad always talked about, uh,###he was in c c c during, uh,###.###yeah.###.###and he was, uh, a rock rib iowa type republican###and the only good thing he could ever say --n403fb3 about, uh, the whole roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,###.###huh-uh.###.###because he was in it.###he thought that was great.###.###yeah.###.###the rest of it was all hog wash,###but that was great.###.###well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.
6713:53	and the only opposition to it really was that it was, you know, starting some sort of a military elitist type, you know, special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing.	###.###i don't know.###.###yeah###the only,###.###like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and,###.###well, you know that brings up the interesting subject too, you know,### what would you have, who, who, who would --n404a80 determine what these people do --n404a9f.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###you know, if, uh, you know, if it's run --n404c24 by the individual state.###you know like c c c was run --n404d38 by the army###and in effect,###.###huh-uh.###.
6720:24	really there could be, um, some scandals involved, if, you know, it wasn't people that --n405121 were really fair and le-, you know, in a legal way or something,	###.###well, you know that brings up the interesting subject too, you know,### what would you have, who, who, who would --n404a80 determine what these people do --n404a9f.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###you know, if, uh, you know, if it's run --n404c24 by the individual state.###you know like c c c was run --n404d38 by the army###and in effect,###.###huh-uh.###.###and the only opposition to it really was that it was, you know, starting some sort of a military elitist type, you know, special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing.###.###huh-uh.###.###and, uh, when the politics get real confusing --n405040,###.###yeah,
6779:11	she started some type of, um, national organization for youth to volunteer --n406c01 to teach, tutor other kids to read and, you know, do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards, you know, helpful things,	###it's one of those things on the surface, you know, it seems like a great idea.###it's like a joke i heard --n4061b3 once about, uh, elephant foot soup, you know,###it --n4062ab's easy to do once you find a elephant foot.###.###.###it's, uh, the logistics of the thing that, uh, --n4063a4 gets you going.###.###yeah.###really.###.###.###yeah.###well, it seems like there's, there's a lot,###you don't hear much on the news about young people really, you know, wanting --n4065c0 to do anything good or anything like that,###but you know, i'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that --n406732 really do have good hearts and are willing --n406759 to help and serve and that kind of thing.### i just, i saw on the news the other night that the, uh, the little girl that --n406940 used --n40694b to be the littlest girl on the cosby show, kisha knight pullman, was starting a,###i guess now she's practically a teenager,###.###yeah.###.
6815:99	and they have situations like, like that down there. where they, they have, these, the social, in some sort of way --n407cdc,	###.###.###yeah,### it's, it's, it's just the, you know,###here you are --n40786a to the logistics of the thing again, you know.###.###yeah.###.###who --n407948's going --n407957 to run it, you know,###what,###how,###oh, it's just so many###.###yeah.###.### like, like i said at the beginning i've got so many connections with people in central america.###my daughter-in-law is panamanian, you know,###.###huh-uh.###.
6889:20	and the church helps them out some,	###.###.###he had a direct connection somewhere, uh,###.###yeah,###right.###he felt that he really had an in###so, you know, things he would do --n409566 with an airplane,###.###yeah.###.###but any rate that's off the subject,###.###yeah.###.###but, i,###.### they, they don't get paid --n4096fb for it,### and, um, but there is funding that --n4097b0 comes,###they're supposedly saving up on their own
7017:34	well the, the other thing some people are not aware of --n402341, is they will use their a, their credit card like their visa or their mastercard for cash	###but, uh, i take the checkbook###so i, you know, i, just, if i need cash, i just tell him###and he gets it out###and i don't even think i know my number.###.###well, i find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have --n401f19 to continue --n401f28 to write checks, in order --n401f47 to get cash.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###that's right.###see we, he couldn't do without it, h-, but, you know, since he can just do it right there at work, for nothing.###.###oh, that helps.###.###.###right.###.###yeah.###.
7091:13	and, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, i didn't realize i had this much, you know, i'd spent this much money.	###.###yes.###everybody in the country is preapproved, i think --n4031d6.###.###i think so,###you're right.###.###so,###.###well, it --n4032ee's interesting, uh, that, uh, people have the, generally the same view. of credit cards, no matter where you go --n403361.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###.
7100:11	well, and some people use one credit card --n403883 to pay for another credit card they own --n4038ae,	###well, it --n4032ee's interesting, uh, that, uh, people have the, generally the same view. of credit cards, no matter where you go --n403361.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###and, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, i didn't realize i had this much, you know, i'd spent this much money.###.###that much stuff.###.###.###right.###.###and, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it.###.
7265:10	we did some remodeling when we bought a house --n402628,	###we're looking for a baby-sitter###so we've been out twice in o-, in this year so far. by ourselves without the child###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's kind of, uh, become an issue you could say --n4022f7.###.###sure.###.###um, hobbies,###i like, --n4023e3 messing around in your house building things, and, you know, putting cabinets up, and, those kind of things, um,###.###oh yeah,###that's great, too.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,
7267:12	and painting and some wallpapering,	###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's kind of, uh, become an issue you could say --n4022f7.###.###sure.###.###um, hobbies,###i like, --n4023e3 messing around in your house building things, and, you know, putting cabinets up, and, those kind of things, um,###.###oh yeah,###that's great, too.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###we did some remodeling when we bought a house --n402628,###we built, put a kitchen in and, um, that kind of stuff,
7282:17	kind of gives you some space for yourself,	###.###.###yeah,###we did some remodeling when we bought a house --n402628,###we built, put a kitchen in and, um, that kind of stuff,###and painting and some wallpapering,###that's fun.###.###it's really kind of fun.###.###it is.###it really is.###.###especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty,###yeah.###.###yeah,###exactly.###i like things that, you know, two people can do --n402a0a,###but i like the quiet of doing things away, you know,
7285:11	i made some afghans and that kind of stuff.	###we did some remodeling when we bought a house --n402628,###we built, put a kitchen in and, um, that kind of stuff,###and painting and some wallpapering,###that's fun.###.###it's really kind of fun.###.###it is.###it really is.###.###especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty,###yeah.###.###yeah,###exactly.###i like things that, you know, two people can do --n402a0a,###but i like the quiet of doing things away, you know,### kind of gives you some space for yourself,###and that's what i find --n402bfb in making the dolls and things, that it gives me something that i can create --n402c46,###and i like --n402d59 to crochet and knit.
7361:10	they have some nice stuff down there.	###.###yeah,###yep,###.###all that stuff that --n4038bb's bad for you.###.### i, i lived in abilene for a little while, and, uh, worked in the abilene plant,###.###oh, sure,###yeah.###.###and we used --n403a98 to go to joe allen's barbecue,###and, uh, oh, that was great.###.###oh, yeah.###.###really great,###.###that's, uh, only way to do it --n403c1a.###.
7526:63	the elections where they have that topic --n402e25 seem --n402e30 to be a little bit better --n402e4f attended than some of the other ones.	###yeah.### that's, that's true.###i think in, uh, the texas governor elections, i think more people turned out --n402427 to vote against somebody than for somebody, this time.###.###yeah,###well, that, uh,###mumblex i know that there's certain issues that --n4025e0 can really motivate people because we live in a pr-, pr-, predominately catholic type area,###.###oh, really.###.###and when things start, uh,### when, when abortion comes on the issues --n40282c and people just get all insp-, inspired, you know,###.###right.###.###and, uh, still on the other hand we're also, uh,###this particular community is a catholic community###but, uh, uh, down in d c where, where things are a little bit different --n402ad0, uh, you know, it's, it's women's rights and the, and that sort of movement,###and so it's, uh, quite the opposite,###so elections start --n402d99 getting very, uh,
7537:34	i can understand why, why some of the, the rural areas, the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in d c are like controlling things for the, the midwest --n403247,	### when, when abortion comes on the issues --n40282c and people just get all insp-, inspired, you know,###.###right.###.###and, uh, still on the other hand we're also, uh,###this particular community is a catholic community###but, uh, uh, down in d c where, where things are a little bit different --n402ad0, uh, you know, it's, it's women's rights and the, and that sort of movement,###and so it's, uh, quite the opposite,###so elections start --n402d99 getting very, uh,###the elections where they have that topic --n402e25 seem --n402e30 to be a little bit better --n402e4f attended than some of the other ones.###.###yeah,###that's true.###.###but, uh,###.###yeah,###that's true that the different places in america that, uh, you know, different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place.###.###yeah,
7586:13	mumblex hope some of the local,	###.###right,###after the war.###.###uh-huh.###.###that really, uh,###.###unfortunately that will probably even drop lower, the voters turndown, mumblex even more because more democrats will think that they don't have a shot###so they won't even bother --n404133 turning out.###.###uh, that's true,###yeah.###.###they'll just say, oh, well, you know, the republicans have this election###we'll see you in four years.###.###right.###yeah.###.
7758:15	but, there are some others out there that i don't believe --n40043a deserve the money they're getting --n40045d.	###bye.###.###.###here goes sharon.###.###okay.###.###well, what do you think --n40008b about nolan ryan being the first baseball player --n4000b6 to earn a million dollars.###that's the only thing i found --n4001b8 out tonight.###.###oh, you found that out tonight.###.###yeah.###.###i haven't even heard that,###that's great.###i think he deserves every penny of it.###.###yeah.###.
8656:24	you want --n403328 to get into some kind of manufacturing,	###.###because, um, he really wants me to concentrate on my studies.###.###yeah.### what are you, what are you studying --n402f5c.###.###i'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering.###.###and what do you think you'll do --n40309b with that.###.###with those degrees.###.###uh-huh.###.###well, i can, i can work up, um, here up to a year.###.###and.###.###and hopefully get a job after that.###.
8687:12	so she brings some money in.	###.###yeah,###you know, anywhere from, um, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, you know, all that,###and so, well, you have a family, right.###.###yeah,###i have a wife and two children###and, um,###.###and does, does your wife work.###.###no.###she doesn't work,###she does, uh,###well, it's kind of hard to say --n4039db now days,###um, other than taking care of the house, she does a lot of sewing herself.###.###oh, okay.###.###and she gets paid --n403bb3 for that
8716:102	we've got a, several credit cards that sometimes, um, instead of --n404672 paying --n40467d them all off every month maybe you have --n4046a4 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around christmas time.	###yeah.###.###and, uh, do that on a, on a full time basis here in town.###.### and so, and you have a monthly budget.###.###well, s-, sort of.###we're probably like most am-, american families,###i guess, that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got --n404109 at the end of the month,###.###right.###.###and we know what bills --n40424d have --n404258 to be paid --n40426b,###and, uh, we pay as many of those bills that --n404327 can be paid --n40433a with, with the monthly budget,###so.###.###so, you don't have any problem in, um, overcharging on your credit card, and stuff like that.###.###oh sure.###we're like everybody else, you know,
8767:6	and some you don't care about --n405a25, you know,	###and i, i knew he needed an alarm clock.###.###yeah.###.###so, i bought him an alarm clock.###so, the thing was that, that,###.###that's great. utilitarian.###.###.###right,###but###.###necessary things, no frivolous gifts.###.###right,###but, um, the thing is, especially remember when i was down in argentina --n405771### it was, to me it was ridiculous, because you know, you have --n405853 to,###once a year you go out###and you spend all this money on all these people,
8865:47	but one of the things that i do --n400281 when i've got some spare time --n4002a4 is i do some woodworking.	###is that okay.###.###yeah.###.###all right.###.###all right.###well, nice talking to you.###.###nice talking to you.### have a good time.###.###all right.###bye-bye.###.###bye.###.###.###i guess, um, i'm going to school while i'm working at t i,###so there's not a whole a lot of time that i've got --n400141, uh, for hobbies it seems like --n400168 lately.
8865:67	but one of the things that i do --n400281 when i've got some spare time --n4002a4 is i do some woodworking.	###is that okay.###.###yeah.###.###all right.###.###all right.###well, nice talking to you.###.###nice talking to you.### have a good time.###.###all right.###bye-bye.###.###bye.###.###.###i guess, um, i'm going to school while i'm working at t i,###so there's not a whole a lot of time that i've got --n400141, uh, for hobbies it seems like --n400168 lately.
8866:65	and that, oh, i guess, ranges anywhere from, uh, carpentry work to, um, um, some types of furniture and, um, oh, i don't know what you would call them --n400448, knickknacks, i guess, stuff you hang --n400477 on the wall --n40048a to put a mirror on --n4004a5	###.###yeah.###.###all right.###.###all right.###well, nice talking to you.###.###nice talking to you.### have a good time.###.###all right.###bye-bye.###.###bye.###.###.###i guess, um, i'm going to school while i'm working at t i,###so there's not a whole a lot of time that i've got --n400141, uh, for hobbies it seems like --n400168 lately.###but one of the things that i do --n400281 when i've got some spare time --n4002a4 is i do some woodworking.
8867:13	and i made some, um, candle sconces that you hang --n400701 on the...	###yeah.###.###all right.###.###all right.###well, nice talking to you.###.###nice talking to you.### have a good time.###.###all right.###bye-bye.###.###bye.###.###.###i guess, um, i'm going to school while i'm working at t i,###so there's not a whole a lot of time that i've got --n400141, uh, for hobbies it seems like --n400168 lately.###but one of the things that i do --n400281 when i've got some spare time --n4002a4 is i do some woodworking.###and that, oh, i guess, ranges anywhere from, uh, carpentry work to, um, um, some types of furniture and, um, oh, i don't know what you would call them --n400448, knickknacks, i guess, stuff you hang --n400477 on the wall --n40048a to put a mirror on --n4004a5
8884:22	so i guess i get some of both.	###so there's not a whole a lot of time that i've got --n400141, uh, for hobbies it seems like --n400168 lately.###but one of the things that i do --n400281 when i've got some spare time --n4002a4 is i do some woodworking.###and that, oh, i guess, ranges anywhere from, uh, carpentry work to, um, um, some types of furniture and, um, oh, i don't know what you would call them --n400448, knickknacks, i guess, stuff you hang --n400477 on the wall --n40048a to put a mirror on --n4004a5###and i made some, um, candle sconces that you hang --n400701 on the...###.###yeah,###i have quite a few of those that my uncle made --n4007e8.###.###there's something about working with wood that, that i enjoy --n4008a2, that,###i don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make --n4009d1 or the smell of the wood###but,###.###as you know, i think it's more like the mess you make --n400b1d, isn't it.###you don't have --n400c2d to worry about --n400c40 cleaning it up.###.###yeah,###because it's, it's out there.###you know i don't have --n400da0 to worry about --n400db3 getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust --n400dea,###and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that,###but then, i get the opportunity --n400f80 to vacuum,
8885:15	what --n401082 are some of your things you like --n4010a9 to do --n4010b8.	###but one of the things that i do --n400281 when i've got some spare time --n4002a4 is i do some woodworking.###and that, oh, i guess, ranges anywhere from, uh, carpentry work to, um, um, some types of furniture and, um, oh, i don't know what you would call them --n400448, knickknacks, i guess, stuff you hang --n400477 on the wall --n40048a to put a mirror on --n4004a5###and i made some, um, candle sconces that you hang --n400701 on the...###.###yeah,###i have quite a few of those that my uncle made --n4007e8.###.###there's something about working with wood that, that i enjoy --n4008a2, that,###i don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make --n4009d1 or the smell of the wood###but,###.###as you know, i think it's more like the mess you make --n400b1d, isn't it.###you don't have --n400c2d to worry about --n400c40 cleaning it up.###.###yeah,###because it's, it's out there.###you know i don't have --n400da0 to worry about --n400db3 getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust --n400dea,###and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that,###but then, i get the opportunity --n400f80 to vacuum,###so i guess i get some of both.
8930:19	so, those things they take some time to make --n4022b4.	###i could do with a little less wind,###but i think the, the temperature has been pretty good --n401a50 so far for working outside.###.###yeah.###.###do you find you do most of your, your, uh, crocheting or your knit work around christmas time.###.###i usually start in the fall.###.###yeah.###.###and my husband says i do it, you know, make afghans so i can keep my lap warm.###.###well, that's kind of what my wife says --n401e4b.###she enjoys --n401eca doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her, her legs and feet with --n401f2d while she is working on it.###.###yeah.###.###i know it seems like, she,###i think she made three --n402160 this year one for, uh, my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters.
8957:31	first thing that --n402a2c comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across, you know, back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of, of afghan.	###and it's real easy to do --n4025b2,###and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that###but it's,###.###well, that's kind of like quilting.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###i think tha-,###.###mile a minute.###that's the name of it.###.###mile a minute.###.###mile a minute.###.###well, i'm not sure what she does --n40295a### i, i,
8967:40	if we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected --n402ec9 some time or other, don't worry about it.	###.###mile a minute.###that's the name of it.###.###mile a minute.###.###mile a minute.###.###well, i'm not sure what she does --n40295a### i, i,###first thing that --n402a2c comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across, you know, back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of, of afghan.###i guess that is your standard knitting, isn't it.###.###yeah,###yeah.###usually single crochet would, is, is always starts it off.###.###yeah,###i know,###.
9106:85	do you, uh, do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like ai-, acid rain and some of the pollutants that --n400526 come from, uh, industrial areas, factories and so on.	### have a good time.###.###okay.###bye.###.###bye.###.###.###uh, robert what do you, uh, think, what substances do you think --n400056 are the most, uh, likely causes of air pollution.###.###um, gee,###i don't##, i mean, i, i guess it's the stuff that --n400232 comes out of automobile exhaust, you know,###they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that.###.###right.###.###so, i believe them###but i'm not a chemist.###.
9196:49	but i do think that, um, congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards.	###uh, i don't, uh, i don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals.###uh, maybe just take good care of our cars, and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing.###um,###.###right.###.###apart from that, i, i don't know what we can do --n4023f0 as individuals.###what do you think we can do --n4024e6.###.###uh-huh,###you think, it's more, more to society.###well i guess i kind of agree there.###i, uh,###on an individual basis there isn't a lot we can do --n402722 about a lot of things###but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can, uh, force, uh, government, uh, that we elect --n402852 to deal more seriously with it.###.###yeah.###.###and i do think that we have a responsibility there.###i must admit i'm not always real politically active
9220:44	and in the case of air pollution, it simply might turn out at some point down the road, --n403795 to be so costly --n4037ac --n4037b3 to have --n4037c6 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems, and everything else that we'll spend the money that --n403821's necessary to, uh, to get rid --n403850 of the source of it.	###and it's brought the,###they, uh, really listen to### the, the, uh, lobbyist and, uh, the car manufacturing companies have, uh, you know, have really pushed,###they,###all those re-, restrictions are really too hard,### we can't, we can't quite make that go###and they don't###and then we still live with air pollution.###.###yeah.###.###um, so i suspect that that's one thing that, that as individuals, we can do --n403084, make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators.###but, um, as a society, i think we can do more --n40322c###and that's probably how we ought --n4032d3 to do it --n4032e6. uh, individ-, --n403309 being individually responsible as, uh, gro-, in order --n403340 to be group responsible.###.###yeah,###i guess i'm, i'm to the point where i'm cynical enough that i really don't believe anything will happen unless, unless there's something economically justifiable about it --n403576.###.###right.###.
9279:29	uh, once in a while we'll get some, uh,	###so instead, we spend billions of dollars --n4049f5 going to war.###.###yes.###.###uh, you know, wha-,###however, it might have had other causes.###certainly oil was a big factor.###.###oh certainly,###yes.###.###um, and i think that's probably going --n404c39 to happen with, with such things as air pollution,### when we, when we se-, get serious about cleaning, about our motors in our automobiles --n404db6 then, uh, then maybe, you know, we'll have a little bit of help.###um, uh,###.###yeah.###.###do you have any air pollution in your area.###.###there's not really a lot here in raleigh.
9455:69	well, i mean, i, i, i guess i've been in some places, you know, where the weather was just so mild --n402d64, you know, places like monterey, california or, you know,	###oh, wow.###.###and, we, you, you just get used to air conditioning all the time,###.###oh yes.###.###and this,###it was just,###the humidity was like eighty plus, eighty percent plus###and it was just killing us.###.###oh yeah,###it's terrible.###orlando is the only place i've ever been --n402b48 where i've seen the car sweat --n402b6b.###.###yeah.###.###i mean, that's really bad.###.###yeah,

10895:45	well as, it, as i recall it got some academy awards, didn't it.	###yeah.###.###that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was jewish and one was black###.###uh-huh.###.###and this all took place in the south.###.###oh my.###.###and, uh, normally never the twain shall meet.###.###you bet,###especially in the south.###.###yes,###right,###and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie.###the acting was phenomenal.###.

11219:18	but it does defray it some.	###at least you're trying something.###.###yeah,###yeah,###.###it's just###yeah,###it would be nice if it could be more.###.###and i'm sure that the, uh, driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid --n4022ba --n4022c1 to do so.###.###oh do you really.###.###we sell the paper back to the, uh, to a paper manufacturing company.###.###well that's a neat idea.###.###well, it, it defrays the cost of buying the paper, i think --n40257b.###i,###not by much,
11233:53	you know that was one thing we noticed --n402a90 last week that we had some new people move into our building and, you know, the nice cardboard boxes that you move, packing boxes. and they were just used --n402b1b one time and thrown --n402b32 in the dumpster	###.###well that's a neat idea.###.###well, it, it defrays the cost of buying the paper, i think --n40257b.###i,###not by much,###but it does defray it some.###.###right.###.###enough to make it --n40272a worth our while to have several bins through out the building.###.###well that's, that's really good,###i mean at least they're trying.###.###yeah.###.###yeah###i know a lot of companies that --n40296f waste so much that,###i'm even trying,
11328:16	but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids,	###.###those###and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in --n4041ff, with the nice lids. those get thrown --n40422a away.###.###uh-huh,###right.###.###and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes.###.###that's exactly what i do --n4043d6.###.###those are perfect boxes to put files in --n404463.###.###uh-huh.###they're good for storage and stuff like that.###that's what i do --n4045a8 with a lot of my daughter's things is i'll store her, you know, like her out dated or, out of, out of season clothes in them###and they're just perfect.###.### what, what i've done --n40484c in the past,###i don't have any now,
11353:13	you saved me some money.	###.###and they look just as good.###that's a smart idea.###.###uh-huh,###yeah.###.###i think i'll have --n404c22 to try that.###that's really cute.###.###yeah###well, you know, it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that --n404d4a are all ready with the little design on them or whatever.###.###they're the exact same thing.###that's all they are --n404f17,###they just made them look fancy.###.###uh-huh,###yeah.###.
11397:28	and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category,	###and that's really discouraging.###i mean, i just go ahead and take it to the, the regular place, where it's, you know, they just accept it --n40583c.###.###uh-huh.###.###but they, uh, i think they should###yeah,###if they want people to recycle i think --n405aab it's, uh, you know,###like the aluminum, you know,###it gets people to, uh, --n405c11 doing it, you know,### you might, you don't have --n405ceb to pay them a lot.###.###yeah,###i live near a walmart###and there's a big, uh, uh, huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front,###in fact i think there's two of them, that --n405f00 have several openings,###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's for recycling

12565:50	i believe he was the only one of fifty governors that --n403d33 voted against some kind of resolution of support for israel a few years back.	###yeah###i,###.###and did you know john sununu is, uh, half arab.###.###no, uh,### i, i think i did hear that at one time a long time ago,###.###yeah.###.###because i used --n403aab to live in, uh, massachusetts,###but, uh,###.###right,### in, in fact, when he was governor of new hampshire --n403bba, i believe --n403bd1.###.###yeah,###new hampshire.###.###okay.
12596:58	i mean, i'd like --n404c98 to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region	###well, i don't,###yeah,###i'd certainly, uh, support israel in, in their, their policy that in defending themselves and in, uh, in their handling of their foreign policy,### i think, i think the stand they have --n404326, or, or the way the command respect --n404355,### i, i support that.###i think that is a, a positive thing for them after, um, uh, thousands of years,### they have --n40463a to, uh, they ha-,###i think they in,###when they be-, became a country --n40476e they more than, or, more or less decided they weren't going --n4047b1 to take it anymore,###and, uh.###.###well, they didn't have much choice,###they could either fight or die.###.###yeah,###exactly, exactly###and, uh, um, so, gee,###i lost my train of thought here.### but, uh, um, so, okay###so i can't say whether that, that i'm pro israel or anti israel.
12611:177	and i think that's the problem the p l o has --n405612 is that when they, whenever one group of them decides that they're going --n405661 to negotiate, or they're going --n405684 to do something, they're going --n4056a7 to try --n4056b6 to make some peace --n4056cd, but, uh, the end result is that they, there so many factions of them and, uh, some more violent than others, some with a certain agenda different than the others, or they split,	###exactly, exactly###and, uh, um, so, gee,###i lost my train of thought here.### but, uh, um, so, okay###so i can't say whether that, that i'm pro israel or anti israel.###i mean, i'd like --n404c98 to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region###and looks uh, that the joining of forces for this, uh, uh, desert shield and desert storm thing ended up --n404e17 being a positive thing.###.###it is a positive thing, um,###however, uh, every time an organization such as the p l o says well we'll see if we can work with israel --n404fd7, then, uh, they get embarrassed --n404ffe some, every few months by documents that --n405025 reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them.###.###right.###.###and so you, you basically have, uh, mutually exclusive interests,###either israel is going --n40534f to occupy the area,###or the arabs are going --n4053d8 to occupy the area###and i'm just not sure that, that there's going --n405479 to be any easy permanent solution.###.###yeah,###somebody's going --n405585 to,

13296:18	there are, uh, some groups that --n4012db have their children, you know, go away for a year.	### when, when would people do it --n400750,###when they finished high school --n4007de.###.###i think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal, because a lot of times, i-, if they go straight into college i think they're going in too quick###but,###.###i think particular boys that the maturity,###in fact i wasn't very mature when i left high school --n400b10###and i think there's a, there's a real challenge there.###there's also this, this issue of, of, uh, you know, whether you're really ready,###and i think it gives a different perspective.###.###right,###uh, y-,### i, i think if you've been out of school a year, year and a half, before you start to college, you appreciate college more, than someone that --n400f38 just goes right straight into college.###.###.###the only complication is, is, is how do you fund something like this --n40115f.###.###well, a lot of parents fund their children.
13308:28	i, we were doing some investigating colleges	###right,###uh, y-,### i, i think if you've been out of school a year, year and a half, before you start to college, you appreciate college more, than someone that --n400f38 just goes right straight into college.###.###.###the only complication is, is, is how do you fund something like this --n40115f.###.###well, a lot of parents fund their children.###there are, uh, some groups that --n4012db have their children, you know, go away for a year.###even the religious organizations.###.###yeah,###i think the mormon church has, sends out missionaries that,###.###right.###and the parents fund them for the whole year, year and a half that they're gone --n40155b.###.### that's, uh, it's interesting.###it gets them away from home and, and gets them to do something useful,###although the kids today, though, it, it seems that almost that their concern for money,
13347:26	well, it seems that there's some things like the, uh, the programs at least just go around and, and, and clean up streets and, and, and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things.	###.###well, yeah.###.###or,###.###or say, say the volunteer,### say that, say that it was mandatory.###.###well i, i, i think that they ought --n402909 to have something for the, the unemployed in a voluntary field like the, uh,###.###.###i don't know if you know, remember about the w p a,###.###yes,###my father was in the c c c mumblex.###.###he was in that.###i mean, you know, uh, it's not the best thing in the world,###but, uh, it gave them something to do --n402d62.###.

13588:16	and if it's some salesman, that just makes it even that much worse.	###i'm single,###but when i come home from work --n404b34, there's times i need --n404b57 to pay bills --n404b6a,###i need --n404c58 to balance my checking account,###i need --n404cd0 to do all kinds of different things like that,###and even though it's friends calling, sometimes you just feel like, this is my quiet time,###i need --n404e80 to get things done --n404e97###and the phone ringing bothers me,###but that's, that's where answering machines are nice --n404f85, because if it's really important they'll leave a message###and i can call them back.###.###that's right.###.###but, uh, at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in,###sometimes it is just, i just want --n40524d to get away from the phone ringing because it, it really does annoy me.###and, uh, if i've had a lot of phone calls during the day when occasionally when we have, uh,###like this past week,###we have --n40555b to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system --n40559a,###and, uh, phone rings like crazy###and you come home###and the last thing you want --n40570e to do --n40571d is have --n405730 to answer the phone.
13666:20	i knew there was some type of a tie in there.	###that's it,###that g t e had purchased tigon###and,###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah,###that's what we have --n406d84.###.###except we call it aspen.###.###aspen.###.###yes.###.###huh.###.###and, uh, we,###.###i couldn't remember in tigon had purchased g t e --s phone mail services or if g t e had purchased tigon.
13977:49	i think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or --n400326 helping elderly people.	###.###it's been interesting.###.###you take care.###.###okay.###.###bye.###.###bye.###.###.###okay.###.###okay.###.###well what do you think --n40005a about the idea of, uh, kids having --n400085 to do public service work for a year.###do you think it's a,###.###well, i, i think it's a pretty good idea.
13983:93	i, i, you know, i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that --n4004fa could use some help	###.###bye.###.###bye.###.###.###okay.###.###okay.###.###well what do you think --n40005a about the idea of, uh, kids having --n400085 to do public service work for a year.###do you think it's a,###.###well, i, i think it's a pretty good idea.###i think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or --n400326 helping elderly people.###.###yes,###yes,###def-,###.
14637:17	and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas,	###but, they're raising prices on their tickets.###so they're banking on --n40637f doing good next season.###i think tickets are,###.###again.###.###yeah.###.###what are they going up to --n4064a7,###thirty bucks or something.###.###thirty, or thirty-two for really good tickets.###see, they, they sectioned it out even more.###they used --n406653 to just have like, uh,###first of all it was all one price.###and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else.###and now they're sectioning it off to like from the, from one twenty yard line to the other one,###just on the lower levels is the highest price,###and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level,###and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line.
14653:39	and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets, because a lot of those doctors have season tickets,	###and now they're sectioning it off to like from the, from one twenty yard line to the other one,###just on the lower levels is the highest price,###and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level,###and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line.###and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas,###and then the cheapest of course is going --n406bc4 to be the end, the direct end zones.###but, um, they have about four or five different prices --n406cd1 now, that they're structuring it with --n406cf8,###but obviously yeah, they're all going up, mumblex more or less is what it's going --n406e09 to do --n406e18.###.###so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year.###.###um, you know, i'm not sure,###i'm not positive,### i didn't, i didn't really think about that.###i just remember --n407125 trying --n407130 to figure out where you could get###that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper.###but, not that i'll ever go.###i hadn't been to a cowboys game,### las-, time, last time i went to the cowboys game --n4073bd was during that, um, n f l strike, or the, when they had the scab team, teams in there --n407430,###and it was the, uh, dallas and washington redskins game.
14724:29	and he said, sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes.	###.###uh, i was visiting my son down in dallas,###and.###.###oh, okay,###he works for t i.###.###no,###no,###but his wife has a contract with t i,###and that's how we learned about it --n400731,###uh-huh.###.###oh, okay,###because i'm down at n c state.###.###yeah,###uh-huh.###.###and so i took a class,
14769:69	and what we have --n401a33 to do --n401a42 is, we have --n401a5d to go, uh, --n401a78 get some stuff, steal it, and then, you know, just resell it.	###or ha-, has crime increased,###and if so, why has crime increased --n401125.###.###well, see the problem is, is that, um, what --n4011ca happens is as, that you're, uh, you know, as you go from the country to a city, crime always increases, right.###.###uh-huh.###.###because in the country, people still respect, uh, the property of other people.###.###right.###.###and so, as, as,###and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city.###.###uh-huh.###.###now what --n40168c happens is all those that --n4016ab don't have any money in the country move to the cities,###and they rush --n4017cd to get the same thing.###they say, why can't we have the same things that these other people have --n401880 --n401887,###and the thing that we can do --n401953 is, we need money for drugs,
14833:77	we're going --n403d8f to solve, try --n403da6 to solve the aids problem while, while, you know, some people are getting killed --n403df1 here and there	###well, but you know, the, the strange thing, uh, perhaps, not strange, but something that many people don't realize --n402c39, is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying --n402ca4 to influence the high school kids,###because, uh, i'm a retired educator.###.###okay.###.###and, in fifty-one and fifty-two, the police came to the high school where i was --n402fc6 and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs --n403001 --n403008, how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance, that they were giving their drugs away in order --n403063 to get the kids started --n403082, and so on, and so on.###.###yeah.###.###so it's a problem that --n40333a's been around for over forty years,###and we're just really, uh, uh, now, trying --n403422 to, uh, figure out how to cope with the problem --n40345d because it has grown so huge.###.###yeah,### there's a, there's a, uh, a song that i know --n403605 which --n403610 says, you know, tha-,###it's like, in, uh, nineteen eighty-eight, nineteen eighty-nine, the local, state, and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in america,###and, uh, their figures, i think --n4038f3 are too, so###i mean it's like, compared to, you know, compared to, weapons or stuff like that, i mean, you're spending nothing on, on crime in the country itself.###what you're doing --n403bef is, you, you know,###it's like, you have other things, you know,###you have the aids
14875:221	but the guy at the very top, the one who --n404c65's, who --n404c7c's really making the millions and the millions is the one who --n404cb7 also many times is part of the power structure, uh, the, uh, and had the political uh, pull to keep things from, uh, keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction, other than on the drug dealing,	###.###but i have such a big army outside of my place, that nobody can touch me.###.###that's right.###but they'll,###.###you know, it's like,###of course, i mean i might be, you know, the the leading drug dealer here,###but you won't find me dealing in drugs,###i mean, there's no connection between me and the people that --n4049ea were caught --n4049f9, you know.###.###that's right.###.###.###that's right,###and, they,###one person doesn't know the other person down the line.###.###right.###.
14969:24	i guess i've had some good experience and some bad experience with them.	###.###okay.###.###okay.###.###i was trying --n400052 to get my children quiet for a minute.###.###okay.###.###well, credit cards, boy, that's an easy topic,###.### ye-, yes,###.###isn't it.###.###it is.###it's one we all hold --n400283 dear and near, i'm sure --n4002aa.###.###oh, yes,###yes.
14969:33	i guess i've had some good experience and some bad experience with them.	###.###okay.###.###okay.###.###i was trying --n400052 to get my children quiet for a minute.###.###okay.###.###well, credit cards, boy, that's an easy topic,###.### ye-, yes,###.###isn't it.###.###it is.###it's one we all hold --n400283 dear and near, i'm sure --n4002aa.###.###oh, yes,###yes.
15021:36	i've, i've talked to some who --n401186's really had some bad experience	###.###it --n400e44's too easy to, to run into the gas station.###.###oh, it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything, that way --n400f69.###.###and, mumblex.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###at least that's for me.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###so.###.###but yeah,
15021:56	i've, i've talked to some who --n401186's really had some bad experience	###.###it --n400e44's too easy to, to run into the gas station.###.###oh, it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything, that way --n400f69.###.###and, mumblex.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###at least that's for me.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###so.###.###but yeah,
15068:10	compared to some of the other ones.	###yeah.###.###.###and then they have bad drawbacks, too. i mean high interest,###.###yeah.### it's, it's awfully easy.###.###it's like paying twice.###.###that's true,###that's true,###.###yes,###so, mumblex.###.###i try --n401dc2 to,###i did switch to one, uh, sponsored by the credit union, though.###that seems --n401ede to be a pretty low interest.###yeah,
15155:80	i mean, and it --n400994's nice to, to try --n4009c3 to teach young people some, some, uh, uh, civil, uh, consciousness,	###bye-bye.###.###.###well, how do you feel about it --n400032.###.###well, uh, i don't have any strong convictions about it,###that's for sure.###um, i know i haven't done any peace corps service,###and i don't know anybody in my immediate family that --n400252 has, or, you know, has ever even thought about it.### do you know, uh, do you know anybody that --n4003bc's been it.###.###no,### the, the only people i know --n4004ca that --n4004d5 have done anything remotely like that are people that --n400500 have gone --n40050f to be missionaries,###and that's only because i went to baylor,###and a lot of students from baylor go and, and serve as missionaries during the summer.###but i think, i think that's a terrible idea.###that's like forcing someone to donate to a charity.###.###yeah.###.
15160:90	so, i'd have --n400cc2 to say that, uh, it, you know, the people who --n400d01 do it, well, some feel it's rewarding.	###well, uh, i don't have any strong convictions about it,###that's for sure.###um, i know i haven't done any peace corps service,###and i don't know anybody in my immediate family that --n400252 has, or, you know, has ever even thought about it.### do you know, uh, do you know anybody that --n4003bc's been it.###.###no,### the, the only people i know --n4004ca that --n4004d5 have done anything remotely like that are people that --n400500 have gone --n40050f to be missionaries,###and that's only because i went to baylor,###and a lot of students from baylor go and, and serve as missionaries during the summer.###but i think, i think that's a terrible idea.###that's like forcing someone to donate to a charity.###.###yeah.###.###i mean, and it --n400994's nice to, to try --n4009c3 to teach young people some, some, uh, uh, civil, uh, consciousness,###but forcing them to, to donate basically their time and efforts,###.###yeah,###it's definitely up to the person, uh,
15216:13	like i do some volunteer work here and there,	###.###oh, okay.###.### had a good old time.###.###well, that's good.###.###well, back to the topic at hand.###what other types of community service would they be talking about --n40195c.###i mean, the, the recording mentioned the peace corps.###.###well, it sounded like, i mean, this is like major long term commitment, like a year or six months,###.###yeah.###.### or, so you're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe,###or, you know, i don't know,###i mean, but, uh,###.###i mean, i'm all for --n401d98 donating my time to worthy causes,
15261:29	i think that maybe that's why some people do it --n402b3c is, uh, to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that.	###.###i have this thing against bugs, too.###and seems to me like the peace corps, they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs --n402514 mumblex.###.###yeah,###africa.###.###yeah,### have --n40265a to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything.###i'd probably catch a terrible disease and die.###.###yeah,###well. i doubt that,###but, you know how it is --n402834 mumblex.###.###.### w-, i, i mean, it would, it --n4028db would have --n4028ea to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture --n402925, usually, i guess --n402944.###.###yeah.###.
15261:95	i think that maybe that's why some people do it --n402b3c is, uh, to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that.	###.###i have this thing against bugs, too.###and seems to me like the peace corps, they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs --n402514 mumblex.###.###yeah,###africa.###.###yeah,### have --n40265a to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything.###i'd probably catch a terrible disease and die.###.###yeah,###well. i doubt that,###but, you know how it is --n402834 mumblex.###.###.### w-, i, i mean, it would, it --n4028db would have --n4028ea to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture --n402925, usually, i guess --n402944.###.###yeah.###.
15277:65	after a certain amount of years of service, these employees can take off like six months or something, for some type of sabbatical or some, you know, some, something like that.	### w-, i, i mean, it would, it --n4028db would have --n4028ea to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture --n402925, usually, i guess --n402944.###.###yeah.###.###i think that maybe that's why some people do it --n402b3c is, uh, to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, to do that,###i don't know,###i'd have --n402da0 to be,###i don't know.###.###oh, i don't know either.###mumblex growing up, all i knew --n402ec9 was you go to high school, you, you know, you work, you go to college, you get out of college, and you get a good job and you work.### and, and none of this, you go --n40315b spend two years in the peace corps --n40317e to ex-, to broaden your horizons.###.###uh-huh. well, you know, uh, i know american express,### i'm n-, i'm working at american express now,###and they,
15291:54	it's for, i think, at the same it's for some people to, you know, help them grow in other areas,	###mumblex growing up, all i knew --n402ec9 was you go to high school, you, you know, you work, you go to college, you get out of college, and you get a good job and you work.### and, and none of this, you go --n40315b spend two years in the peace corps --n40317e to ex-, to broaden your horizons.###.###uh-huh. well, you know, uh, i know american express,### i'm n-, i'm working at american express now,###and they,###after a certain amount of years of service, these employees can take off like six months or something, for some type of sabbatical or some, you know, some, something like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they're allowed --n403696 to take that time off and then come back where they left off --n4036d1.###.###oh.###.###so, it is something that i think, uh, you know, even the larger organizations will support --n40380a.###uh, it's, it's really for the community to give, you know, to, to give back to the community type of thing.###.###mumblex.###.###i don't know,
15332:88	everybody i know --n404e96 has been, well, i'm going --n404ec1 to go --n404ed0 get a goo-, good job and make some money and buy a nice car.	###but i think a lot of it's, you know, when the-, people get older --n4046b9, they'll do something like that.###.###i'd probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that --n404843 had gone into the peace corps.###.###yeah.###.###but i don't.###.### i, i, i don't.###.###and none of my,###.### didn't mean --n404a83 to cut you off there.###.###oh, that's okay.### n-, and none of my really close friends in college went off --n404b8d to be missionaries or anything.###so i don't really know anyone --n404c91 first hand that --n404ca8's, that --n404cbf's com-, committed a chunk of their life --n404cee to do service work.###.###i,###.
15382:18	she stuck my name on some list,	###how many times have you talked --n405b7e.###.###oh, probably five or six.###.###yeah.###.###not a whole lot.###.###oh, i've done maybe four or five.###.###yeah.###did dana sign you up for this.###.###well, she just sent me the information out.### i, i got a hold of it, you know,###i just sent it back in,###and.###.###yeah,###that's,
15535:31	now, i've seen, you know, some different clips of it, um,	###uh,###.###really.###.###uh-huh,###one that, you know,###yeah,###it was too long###and they thought that, you know, at certain points that it was going --n400559 to end,###and it didn't,###and it kept --n400685 going on###and,###uh-huh.###.###oh, i thought it was great.###.###really.###.###yeah.###.
15749:21	well, now, we had some friends that --n404586 went --n404591 to see it	###uh yeah,###.###that looks really good too.###.###that looks good.###and there were a couple others that i just haven't had the time --n4040f0.###.###and silence of the lambs.###.###now see i.###.### i'm, i'm intrigued --n404229 by it,###but i'm not sure i want --n4042dd to go --n4042ec see it yet.###.###yeah,###i don't think i want --n4043d5 to see that either.###i know,###i don't think i could.###.###i think, uh,
15755:34	i think they may be playing up um, some aspects of the movie that --n404765 aren't the main aspects.	###.###and silence of the lambs.###.###now see i.###.### i'm, i'm intrigued --n404229 by it,###but i'm not sure i want --n4042dd to go --n4042ec see it yet.###.###yeah,###i don't think i want --n4043d5 to see that either.###i know,###i don't think i could.###.###i think, uh,###well, now, we had some friends that --n404586 went --n404591 to see it###and they said it was okay.###.###really.###.###so, it might not be as,
15843:18	now we've let some people --n400f3d go, uh, that wa-, we, was found that drugs were used --n400f8c in --n400f97 their system.	###and what we do --n4008d3 is we'll have a drug test if an, if a, a break or a man, uh, has an accident.###then he's automatically, uh, given --n400aa2 a drug test.###.###right.###do they do it, like, you know, within hours of the accident,###or is it.###.###yes,###when he goes to the doctor the first time --n400c70.###.###yeah.###.###and so, that kind of, uh,###i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not, because we have, uh, just started --n400dad using it oh, for the past year or so.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.
15849:19	uh, if there's some, uh, problem i know,	###.###yes,###when he goes to the doctor the first time --n400c70.###.###yeah.###.###and so, that kind of, uh,###i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not, because we have, uh, just started --n400dad using it oh, for the past year or so.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###now we've let some people --n400f3d go, uh, that wa-, we, was found that drugs were used --n400f8c in --n400f97 their system.###now, i don't know how t e c would handle it --n401128.###they haven't pursued it, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.
15870:42	and then i also had a friend who --n401879 was just around some people that --n401898 were smoking cocaine.	###there was one guy that we tested --n401306 for preemployment for drugs who --n401321 absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines,###and he went to a, a separate drug testing firm,###.###yeah.###.###and they showed it negative.###.###huh.###.###so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried, you know.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###i think that's probably true, too.### that's, that's, that's sort of scary.###.###uh-huh,###really.
15903:5	some of the places --n401fe5 now, um, like i b m don't allow them smoking, you know in, in the plant.	###.###yeah,### that's, that's a bad situation.### i think that probably, i think most companies now, as far as entry, you know, exams require that.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###i think they should.###.###uh-huh.###.###i'm a t i employee### and and, and, uh, i'm, i'm really gung ho for it.###.###uh-huh.###.###in fact i, you know,
16039:6	in some cases	###yeah,### that's, that's it.###.###i mean, you know, there's all kinds of drawbacks, much less the drug testing.###.###yeah.###just life in general.###.###uh-huh,###that's right.###.###yeah,### well, well i'm definitely for it.###.###yeah.###.###plus, you know, you, you want --n404295 to think that, that you're working with people who --n4042c8 are not only putting out their fair share, but that --n4042fb are not endangering your life,###.###that's right.###.
16054:41	i mean, and they have, they have some serious chemicals out there you know,	###.###plus, you know, you, you want --n404295 to think that, that you're working with people who --n4042c8 are not only putting out their fair share, but that --n4042fb are not endangering your life,###.###that's right.###.###in some cases###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###like, uh, my husband, uh, several years back, worked for motorola.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they had, you know,###i mean it was a chemical handling type.###.###oh, goodness.###.###yeah,
16070:16	so i think some place, you know, places like that, it should be like mandatory like, you know, on, on a, on a greater frequency than maybe, just, you know, paper pushers like, like i am.	###.###oh, goodness.###.###yeah,###i mean, and they have, they have some serious chemicals out there you know,###.###yeah.###.###like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water, you know, that kind of thing --n4048d4.###.###yeah.###.###and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals.###.###oh, my gosh.###.###and that's really, that's really frightening.###.###yeah.###.
16185:33	that's what it said to discuss --n40016a some	###.###yeah,###well, i think we did it.###.###okay.###.###so it --n40645b's good talking to you.###.###well, i enjoyed --n4064fa talking to you, cathy.###.###yeah,###bye-bye.###.###.### ok-, okay.###.### what, what is,###do you have a favorite recipe.###.###um, yeah,

16415:5	some of them, they used --n404cf0 to be a hundred dollars,	###and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it###and i have this thing###it's called --n404790 the slender blender,### it, it makes the, uh, it makes, uh, a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough.###it's, uh,###i don't know,###they're called --n404a0d moo goo leaves or something###they're sl-,###.###i think i know what you're talk-,###is it like a hand held.###.###yeah.###they're real neat.###.###the,###yeah,###okay.###.###i think they're real reasonably priced,

16477:25	ri-, i have some.	###and that makes french vanilla, um, custard.###yeah,###.###oh, wow.###that is really interesting.###are you saying --n4060e3 to use like, um, for chocolate like, unsweetened,###.###a chocolate powder.###.###unsweetened.###.###yeah,###that cocoa, yeah, the unsweetened.###it comes in like a real dark can,###.###yeah.###.###our mothers used --n4062e5 to use it.###and then,###.
16570:13	and, um, some people don't like that, that, film on the pudding	###and then put that back in the saucepan.###.###yep.###and then, you know, if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted --n407a73 to. the cocoa even seems --n407a96 to thicken it even more.###.###huh that's,###.###because by the vanilla doesn't seem --n407c3b to thicken as well as the,###sometimes the cocoa is###like, my husband really likes it thick###he says, i can stick the spoon right in this.###.###oh.###.###because i'm always worrying it won't firm up because it, when you take it out of the saucepan --n407ea3 it's like, boy, i hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick, you know,###when you cook a package --n408100, it's, it's a little less,###.###uh-huh.###.###but i put it in a nice glass bowl
16608:27	i was trying --n40001e to think about some of my favorite people that i liked --n400051 in music	###but, um, i,###my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going --n4089c9 to make it work too hard.###.###right,###that's true.###i knew that.###.###that's,###yeah,###.###yeah.###.###so,, that's why i do that --n408bea.###.###yeah.###.###so, well, i don't know###that's my, my great hard recipe.###.###.

18836:36	but i'm sure that they can, uh, find some sort of, uh, use for them if, you know, you know, there,	###yeah,###the one thing i wish we could recycle --n4018f5 is magazines.###but they claim that because of the way they're bound --n4019c8 --n4019cf they, uh, it --n4019ea's too expensive to recycle them.###at my office, we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes --n401b59 --n401b60 to pick up their mail,###.###yes.###.###and they're, uh,###one's for white paper###and one's for colored paper###so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so-, things like that goes in those boxes,###.###uh-huh.###.###but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines,###and there's no way to get rid --n401f21 of them --n401f30.###it just seems like such a waste.###.###oh, it does.###it does.
19045:21	and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic --n406d20 and, uh, they're recycling them into other plastics. and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that --n406d7f	###but i,###that's not going --n4067fe to be a regular feature.###that was just a one time thing right after christmas.###.###well, the,###but, uh, something nee-, does need --n40695f to be done --n406972 about the styrofoam that, uh,###.###well, those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills.###.###oh, yeah,###i mean, they don't, uh, uh,###.###they don't mash.###.###no.###.###they don't compress at all.###and they stay forever.###.###right.
19059:71	and you're not going --n4073a3 to bother --n4073b2 if you have one bag full, --n4073d5 to drive all the way to some recycling center --n407400 to turn in just your little plastic peanuts.	###no.###.###they don't compress at all.###and they stay forever.###.###right.###and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic --n406d20 and, uh, they're recycling them into other plastics. and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that --n406d7f###.###uh-huh.###.###and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines.###.###yeah,###i do too.###the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile.### it, they really have --n407135 to rely on businesses that --n407150 generate a lot of that stuff.###.###right.###.###uh, because otherwise, uh, you know, they're not going --n4072a3 to go house-to-house --n4072b6 collecting it,
19161:75	the evidence is that, uh, you know, he's, he's let some, some stuff --n4019f8 go, you know, the east german situation.	###yeah.###yeah.###i thi-,###yeah,###the thing that --n40123d keeps --n401248 happening is happening so fast and so, uh, dramatic that you almost think, now wait a minute, you know,###we're getting stuck --n4013e3 into something here, you know,###.### if, if somebody's about --n4014a2 to, to clobber you, the first thing they do --n4014e5 is sort of say, well, you know, we're, we're ashamed, we're not going --n401548 to do that anymore.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###speakera18-1*t18-1.###exactly.###speakerbnan*t18-1.###speakerb18-2*t18-2.###and, uh,, um, you know, i'd, i'd like --n4017f9 to think that that isn't true###but i, i, you know,###speakeranan*t18-2.###.
19185:13	it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine.	###speakerbnan*t20-1.###speakerb20-2*t20-2.###it's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible, you know,###speakeranan*t20-2.###speakerb23-1*t23-1.###if i'd have been asleep for five years, and read it in a book, i said, no, no, no, that didn't, couldn't have happened that way.###speakeranan*t23-1.###speakera23-2*t23-2.###right.###speakerbnan*t23-2.###.###well, it --n401e84's amazing just because of the drain that --n401eab's been on, you know, both economies that our economy is, of course, been able --n401efe to, uh, withstand that a little better,###.###uh-huh.###but, uh, the russian economy### they, you know, they,###i don't know what the percentages are --n4021cc,###but i heard it one time,###.###speakera26-1*t26-1.
19223:138	and, you know, i even had a thought --n4030ab once that the whole iraqi thing might have been just a, a deal --n4030f6 to go ahead and let us, uh, you know, expend some, some military hardware.	###even if it is, you know, the best thing in the long run, it just steps on too many people --n402889's toes, who --n4028a0 are comfortable with the way the situation is --n4028cb.###.###.###yeah.###yeah,### i, i think, you know, what i'd have --n402a94 to,###.### i, i gues-, i guess --n402ba8 to answer the question directly, i'm still just a, a little bit, you know, leery of the whole thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###what i haven't seen --n402db8 is the, uh, you know, a great stepping back in the military, situation.###.###speakera38-1*t38-1.###right.###speakerbnan*t38-1.###speakerb38-2*t38-2.###you know, it's, it --n402f1e's one thing, you know, to let us go ahead and sort of disarm###speakeranan*t38-2.###.
19284:42	and i think he's actually, honestly trying --n404690 to do some change.	###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###well, the, the china situation, you know, the when, it looked like that thing was, was turning around --n40419b###and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the, in the red square or wherever said, okay,###.###and that's enough.###.###uh-huh.###.###and the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that.###.###exactly.###.###and,###yeah,###uh, that,###mumblex personally i don't see as gorbachev as --n4045c6 being maybe a threat,###.
19295:81	well, this would be like if somebody was elected --n404a1c president of the united states and suddenly took off toward, you know, just some pretty hard by the socialism,	###and the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that.###.###exactly.###.###and,###yeah,###uh, that,###mumblex personally i don't see as gorbachev as --n4045c6 being maybe a threat,###.###and i think he's actually, honestly trying --n404690 to do some change.###.###uh-huh.###.###speakera64-1*t64-1.###but i don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, --n404799 being the first one --n4047b4 to really turn things around or attempt --n4047d7 to is going --n4047ee to be allowed --n404801 to get away with it either.###speakerbnan*t64-1.###speakerb64-2*t64-2.###yeah.###speakeranan*t64-2.###.
19360:7	and some of the countries that --n406266 were forced --n406275 in at th-, later dates is the three baltic countries, you know, --n4062c8 came in, in the forties,	###speakera75-2*t75-2.###now i realize that the origins are, are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with, and that they may have been forced --n405be8,###speakerbnan*t75-2.###.###i'm not that familiar with their future,###.###uh-huh.###but i, you know, i,###.###it --n405e66's easy to believe that they were probably more --n405e95 forced --n405ea0 into a pact than, uh, a volunteer or willingness to join.###.###yeah.###.###but,### there, there was the whole thing was put --n406059 together, you know, by force.###.### there's, there's no, no real question about that.###.###uh-huh.###.
19435:15	you know, some reason or other, you know, is, uh,	###you know, that's going --n40772a to be the safest place to be --n407755.###speakeranan*t103-1.###speakera103-2*t103-2.###that's probably very true.###ve-,###that's very interesting,###speakerbnan*t103-2.###speakera104-1*t104-1.### never thought of that.###speakerbnan*t104-1.###speakerb104-2*t104-2.###yeah,###well, uh, i, i guess, what they'd have --n40796a to do --n407979 to,###i really don't know, you know,### in, in the, in, you know,###speakeranan*t104-2.###.###i hope that what --n407bd2's happening is exactly the way it appears --n407bfd.###.###uh-huh.
19474:11	they had some real fancy names for them.	###boris yeltsin, the guy that --n4082d0's running the, uh, or evidently was elected --n408307 president of the soviet, for the russian republic, which --n40833a is, i guess, the, uh, the biggest,###.###.###right.###.###.###exactly.###.###i get confused between all the, which --n40856f is the soviet provinces versus which --n40858e are the, the russian provinces, versus what --n4085b9 are,###.###.###uh-huh.###well, in the center###but you got a, the, the great big area that --n4087a5's just, was traditionally known --n4087d0 as russia and then all these little nationality groups, around it, you know, that --n40881b were, you know,###.###was there nineteen of them or, or whatever,###.###uh-huh.###you know, and these were all the soviet economists, us you know,###.
19535:18	although, i've seen some evidence that, you know, the, uh, the russian soldiers are,	###.###well, wonder if that,###.###well, i mean at,###wh-, uh, w-, what do you get shot --n4096ef by --n4096fa###.###speakerb139-1*t139-1.###something that --n40978a's called --n409799 a, an economic force or what --n4097bc is called --n4097cb a military pact,###speakeranan*t139-1.###speakera139-2*t139-2.###yeah,###speakerbnan*t139-2.###.###exactly.###you know, it's all,###you can change the name of something###.###but i wonder if it's still, exists.###.###uh-huh.
19697:27	it was made --n40256d to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, you know, it was, uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who --n402604 were in areas, uh, in rebellion against the united states.	###yeah.###.###and it's not a story of the civil war,###it's a story of all the politics and, uh, lobbying and just basically state by state events, that --n401f38 lead to the events that --n401f53 brought about the civil war.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's fascinating because i had always, you know, been raised --n4020f9 on this, you know, emancipation proclamation with the civil war.###.###uh-huh.###there was a lot more to it than that, weren't there.###.###there was a lot more to it than that.###as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that --n4023e0 kind of become like an afterthought.###.###yeah,###well, it was a political move.###.###oh, yeah.###.
19728:11	where's some reference to this goddamn state of texas and the role that they played --n403093 either leading up to --n4030aa or in --n4030b9 the civil war --n4030cc.	###uh-huh.###.###uh,###.###i've got the same problem.###.###yeah,###i'm glad you put it that way.###.###.###and i have two native texan children too.###.###yeah.###.###my husband is always, you know, talked about th-, texas being a, uh, rebel state.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, oh, my god, all this civil war pride.###i kept --n402ffa waiting for,

19745:104	if you ever get a chance to go over to vicksburg, the battleground at vicksburg, uh, there's an area there where there was, uh, some texas, uh, groups --n40384c	###.###and, oh, my god, all this civil war pride.###i kept --n402ffa waiting for,###where's some reference to this goddamn state of texas and the role that they played --n403093 either leading up to --n4030aa or in --n4030b9 the civil war --n4030cc.###.###mayb-,### isn't much there, was there.###.###they might as well have not even been there.###.###right.###.###you know, they weren't a state###and the only, the only way that they had any part in it --n4033c1 was after worth as to, you know, who --n4033f0's going --n4033ff to be going there.###and i keep --n403585 telling my husband that,###and he keeps --n4035fd saying, oh, no.###i thought, okay.###.###they supplied some, uh, you know,###they were some groups of it, the vicksburg,
19933:5	some of those get very philosophical	###.###and they had a centennial here awhile back.###i read the grant takes command,###that was pretty good.###.###well,###.###that was part of that trilogy that, uh, bruce canton did --n406e8c.###.###now that's one that, that's one###.###.###i don't know.###see, i had never really been into science fiction that much until, uh, somebody gave me mist of avalon probably about five or six years ago.###.###yeah.###.###i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy.###.###sometimes it's awful hard,
19999:14	um, well, some history, books are pretty scary,	###i just remember sting was in it.###.###oh, really..###.###yeah,###and if you were trying --n408176 to follow any type of, uh, plot, it, it total-,###-n40828f even having read the book, and i've read that book probably three times, --n4082d6 watching that movie, i couldn't figure out, what they were talking about --n408319, at all.###.###uh-huh.###.###.### couldn't,###.###.###yeah.###.###i was real disappointed in that.###well, i'll tell you another good book,###do you like scary things.###.
20045:19	even better than jaws and some of that.	###just chilling.###.###no, uh,###i don't have the foggiest notion what it's about --n408c89,###so.###.###then i won't tell you.###.###okay,###yeah.###but,###.###it's just that if you're ever, ever really want --n408e04 to just be scared --n408e1b out of your wits,###.###uh-huh,###that's the one.###.###that's the one.###yes.###.
20142:232	well, i think in a way, though, uh, uh, i also have, uh, an opposite point of view, which --n4022cc is, uh, although i believe we should, uh, permit, uh, you know, constant immigration into this country uh, i think we should, uh, primarily for economic reasons, i think we should have, um, some quotas,	###both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants###so, i'm a little touchy --n4018c2 every now and then about that.###.###yeah.###well, uh, my, uh, my family is from, uh, europe from, well, from england and ireland and, uh, have been in this country for, oh, more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh, my.###.###so, i don't have any, any, uh, relatives that i am, or, or, uh, several generations back, that i am familiar with --n401c95 their names and how they fit into the family --n401cc0.### they were all, they were all born --n401e89 here###.###uh-huh.###.###so i don't have any real strong ties with any, with, with the immigration laws.### i don't, because i don't, i don't have any personal feelings about them###and i haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are --n4021b2.###.
20170:26	there are, were some, uh, regulations --n403473 over, i don't know whether they're laws passed or, or whatever they're called --n4034c6 --n4034cd, uh, just recently, where, uh, people with certain diseases can not be excluded --n40351c, uh, from, uh, immigration --n403543.	###.###uh-huh.###.###so, you know,###but, uh i think unrestricted immigration, i think --n402a77, is not, uh, is not best, uh.###.###yeah.### i, i, well, i agree with that,###.###.### i, i think if immigration was entirely unrestricted, uh, not only would, would the united states become over populated, well, more over populated awfully quickly, i think --n402d2b it, it would bring in a lot of, uh, people that --n402d76 are, run --n402d89 out of other countries or in trouble in, in other countries.###i think they'd come here --n4030a4 trying --n4030af to find a new market for their, their brand of crime.###.###uh-huh.###well, you know, there's another aspect of this, too.###they're also, uh, uh, diminishing the, uh, health restrictions which,###.###i was not aware, aware of that.###.###well, yes.
20176:47	so i think in, in some as-, some ways we are, uh, becoming a little too egalitarian in that, in that sense,	###yeah.### i, i, well, i agree with that,###.###.### i, i think if immigration was entirely unrestricted, uh, not only would, would the united states become over populated, well, more over populated awfully quickly, i think --n402d2b it, it would bring in a lot of, uh, people that --n402d76 are, run --n402d89 out of other countries or in trouble in, in other countries.###i think they'd come here --n4030a4 trying --n4030af to find a new market for their, their brand of crime.###.###uh-huh.###well, you know, there's another aspect of this, too.###they're also, uh, uh, diminishing the, uh, health restrictions which,###.###i was not aware, aware of that.###.###well, yes.###there are, were some, uh, regulations --n403473 over, i don't know whether they're laws passed or, or whatever they're called --n4034c6 --n4034cd, uh, just recently, where, uh, people with certain diseases can not be excluded --n40351c, uh, from, uh, immigration --n403543.###age is one, for example,###and, uh, recently, uh, tuberculosis, which at one time, if you had --n403822 tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh, they dropped that also.###.###uh-huh.###.
20307:42	i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there.	###that's true.###.###you don't sound like you're from dallas.###where do you, do you come from --n4024da originally###texas.###.###yeah.###i do.###i've lived in, in the dallas area here since i was like four.###.###oh, okay.###.###so. uh, it's, i don't know, an urban area, i guess --n402732###whatever.###i don't know.###.### you just, you just managed --n40284e to escape the real texan accent,###.###yeah.###.
20718:26	well, i know that we have some relatives that --n10204 live around, like the mumblex area in there,	###i can tell.###.###well, i know they will,###and besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed.###.###okay,###yeah,###me, too.###.###well, have a good day.###.###you, too.###bye.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###well, since you live close, i don't know if you know, um, about what louisville is doing --n1006a with recycling,###or are you familiar with any of that.###.

20726:124	when they first started --n1049c doing that in the paper, and i read about that --n104cf, i was just praying that, that would be in our area, because we've been recycling for quite some time.	###.###well, have a good day.###.###you, too.###bye.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###well, since you live close, i don't know if you know, um, about what louisville is doing --n1006a with recycling,###or are you familiar with any of that.###.###well, i know that we have some relatives that --n10204 live around, like the mumblex area in there,###.###huh-uh.###.###i know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there.###.###yeah.###you know, i read, you know,

20734:79	they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind wal-mart, that --n10954 take some things.	###.###well, since you live close, i don't know if you know, um, about what louisville is doing --n1006a with recycling,###or are you familiar with any of that.###.###well, i know that we have some relatives that --n10204 live around, like the mumblex area in there,###.###huh-uh.###.###i know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there.###.###yeah.###you know, i read, you know,###when they first started --n1049c doing that in the paper, and i read about that --n104cf, i was just praying that, that would be in our area, because we've been recycling for quite some time.###and, you know, we separate everything out, and then have --n106f9 to haul it up to a metco, you know, which --n10730 is a real pain.###.###huh-uh.###.###so if they would come up,###curbside recycling,###.
20838:36	and so, you know, when i found out some places to take it --n12dcb --n12dd2,	###.###.###and they're impossible --n12811 to crush --n12820.###i mean, you can't get the down to any size, you know.###if you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you know pretty easily,###so. you know,###.###i guess we kind of started --n12ab8 recycling after i moved here about a year and a half ago.###.###oh, really.###.###we were using baby food###and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what --n12c55 started it.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###some of our neighbors were doing it
20839:32	and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there,	###.###and they're impossible --n12811 to crush --n12820.###i mean, you can't get the down to any size, you know.###if you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you know pretty easily,###so. you know,###.###i guess we kind of started --n12ab8 recycling after i moved here about a year and a half ago.###.###oh, really.###.###we were using baby food###and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what --n12c55 started it.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###some of our neighbors were doing it###and so, you know, when i found out some places to take it --n12dcb --n12dd2,
20840:72	and i know that they're going --n12fc5 to use, you know, the money for that --n12ff4 to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. put lights and stuff	###and they're impossible --n12811 to crush --n12820.###i mean, you can't get the down to any size, you know.###if you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you know pretty easily,###so. you know,###.###i guess we kind of started --n12ab8 recycling after i moved here about a year and a half ago.###.###oh, really.###.###we were using baby food###and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what --n12c55 started it.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###some of our neighbors were doing it###and so, you know, when i found out some places to take it --n12dcb --n12dd2,###and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there,
21020:14	but, uh, some of the crap that --n401787's on t v nowadays, it's about.	###yeah.###yeah.###.###.### and then, uh, but i don't know,###it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic, you know, magnified and animated, that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings.###.###huh-uh.###.###.###huh-uh.###.###and so, uh, now i do, with the cosby show,###i have seen it a couple of times###and, i do,###i like the show.###i just don't watch it. because of the timing,###.###yeah.###.
21123:14	i think some of the tones of the, the daily prime time is questionable,	###.###i was just a youngster###and i was like, oh, my gosh.###.###yeah,###we used --n402f1a to,###my mother watched all that stuff, too.###and as the world turns. i think as the world turns may, still on or not.###.###still be on.###.###it was not too long ago.###.###yeah.###now they got a lot of other crap involved.###and so,###.###yeah.###.###you're right.
21258:50	in fact, there was one show that he even turned down a date with some, you know, beautiful woman --n401781 just because the idea that he was, his mind was on the ozone layer and, you know, global warming and all this other kind of stuff.	###.###he is.###.###and i told my husband, that's the whole point,###but###.###yeah,###that's right,###i mean,###.### i, i just,###it's,###i find him degrading at times.###i guess that is the point,###but sometimes it just,###.###well, they, they really have changed him though.### if, if you've watched it this season, um, he's becoming, i mean, he still is in his own way degrading and everything,###but, uh, he's involved in that charity,###and, uh, it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought, that he really has,
22018:5	some of them are interested.	###then you'll never leave.###.###yeah,###i know,###and that's, that's what --n4086b7 happened to my brother.###he came to school up here,###and then when he went down there --n4087eb, he was just so bad off, you know from --n40881e not being able --n408831 to stay up here that his life just went down the drain.###.###oh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###so.###.###well maybe something will open up for you.###.###yeah,###i've been calling a lot of companies.###there,
22419:43	you didn't get a big kick out of --n400826 killing them like some people do.	###so i don't fish too much in saltwater.###.###uh-huh.###most of my fishing has been in the saltwater. uh, mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish###.###oh, really,###.###.###oh, neat,###.###and, uh, i have caught one or two small sharks###.###oh, really.###.###and, uh, yes.###.###what'd you do --n40075a with them.###.### put them back.###.
22445:111	so, i have not done, uh, much freshwater fishing oh, for, you know, lake, lake fishing for bass and so forth but, uh, maybe some what they call --n401352 brim and those sorts of things, but nothing,	###but, uh, the ones i caught --n400995 were never large enough to really do anything.###.###do they have a limit on sharks,###i mean, is that like a, a sport fish,###can you actually catch those###and there's no limit.###.###is there a limit.###i have no idea.###i know, i,###my home is in, uh, pensacola, florida###.###uh-huh.###.###so, it's, they do a lot of shark fishing in that, you know, in the gulf###.###right.###.###and, um, there's a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from, i guess from galveston to mayport they have, uh, shark tournaments --n400f97,###and, you know, there's part, either as part of --n401157 or separate from --n40116a the, uh, bill fishing tournaments they usually have --n40119d
22630:77	of course what i used --n4047e5 to like --n4047f4 to do --n404803 though is go --n40481a snorkeling for scallops --n40482d in some of the bays, or uh, or oy-, for oysters.	###.###right,###and it was, it was really, really, really bad.###uh, i, as i said, i am a fisher,###i'm not a catcher.###.###right.###.###but, uh, i enjoy it though.###i don't really get out as much as i, uh, as i would like --n4043aa too.###.###yeah.###.###and they do, of course, you know,###here in,### we're only just a few, not a few minutes, we're, you know, forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in maryland###.###right.###.###and they do a lot of fishing there.
22656:29	so, we thought well, maybe there are some crab in here,	###.###and, uh, that i was able --n404ab5 to do --n404ac4, when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom --n404b0b.###.###right.###.###.###hand picked.###.###that right.###.###the weirdest fishing experience i ever had --n404ca0. people to this day are still trying --n404cc7 to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught --n404d02.###we were in, uh, rockport, which --n404e72 is close to corpus###.###uh-huh.###.###and we had been fishing in a canal,###they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area,###and, uh, we'd been fishing in the canals###and all we were catching --n4050c2 were catfish,###and we were pretty bored with that.
22657:23	we'll try --n405259 to catch some crab.	###and, uh, that i was able --n404ab5 to do --n404ac4, when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom --n404b0b.###.###right.###.###.###hand picked.###.###that right.###.###the weirdest fishing experience i ever had --n404ca0. people to this day are still trying --n404cc7 to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught --n404d02.###we were in, uh, rockport, which --n404e72 is close to corpus###.###uh-huh.###.###and we had been fishing in a canal,###they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area,###and, uh, we'd been fishing in the canals###and all we were catching --n4050c2 were catfish,###and we were pretty bored with that.###so, we thought well, maybe there are some crab in here,
22696:54	i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught --n4060d3 is, uh, in some of the inlets and the rivers around mumblex delaware.	###and it had the rock --n405a2d in its mouth, not the chicken,###but the rock itself is what it had grabbed --n405ae4.###.###um.###.###they say it's a dog fish, from everything i've described --n405bb4,###it was brown with these little white dots###.###uh-huh.###.###and it made a loud --n405cf4, almost a croaking --n405d0b noise like a croaker does###.###uh-huh.###.### it, it was the strangest thing.###oh, i'll never get over that.###to this day i don't want --n405ed2 to get in the water, anywhere around salt water because i'm sure one of those fish are there.###.###.###well, we used --n40604f to,
22799:53	but, um, we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted --n10c3f to give him some medication to sort of, you know keep him real out of it all the time	###.###.###well, i've had a touch of experience.###my, um, dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him --n107bc###.###yeah,###if it's a have to thing,###yeah,###i,###yeah.###.###and, uh, she put him in,###but he wasn't there very long before he died###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, i guess, um, the one time that i saw him there --n10aa1, you know, as far as the surroundings, that seemed okay.###.###uh-huh.###.
22932:13	now there is some really nice ones.	###no.###.###.###uh-huh,###and everything you worked so hard for --n12b56 all your life###.###yeah###.###yeah.###.###and if you're still capable of --n12c24 driving and doing those things, then you feel like, well, gee, i'm, you know, i'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's kind of a, that's a hard one,###but it is a very nice nursing home.###.
22933:25	there's also, you know, some private ones, you know	###.###.###uh-huh,###and everything you worked so hard for --n12b56 all your life###.###yeah###.###yeah.###.###and if you're still capable of --n12c24 driving and doing those things, then you feel like, well, gee, i'm, you know, i'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's kind of a, that's a hard one,###but it is a very nice nursing home.###.###now there is some really nice ones.
22992:33	and then on the other hand, i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know.	###well, yeah,###i've talked to my mother about that several times lately,###and i, i said, i want you to have control of your own business.###.###yes.###.###but, you know, what if.###.###yeah,###my mother's seventy now,###so naturally she's retired,###but she's still on her own, i mean --n13f8d.###.###yeah,###yeah,###my mother's, uh, seventy-five and still has her own home and everything.###.###i think that's wonderful,###i really do,###just as long as they can,
23017:54	but i guess once you get ill, then, you know, you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things.	###that's true.###they have a lot of people around to do things with.###.###uh-huh,###they're not lonely.###.###some of those places have wonderful activities and things, you know, lots of stuff going on.###.###oh, yes,###uh-huh.###.###and they'll take them places###.###yeah.###.###so. i don't know,###it's not all bad###.###no.###.
23136:113	seems so much easier --n401b89 --n401b90 just to take it and throw it in the trash, and have them pick it up than it --n401be3 is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them.	###but, then i just, you know, bundle it up and put it on the front, you know, the front walk ev-, you know, every monday or every other monday, and have them pick that up,###.###yeah.###.###but that's the extent of what i've done --n401429.###i'd like --n4014b8 to be able --n4014cb to do more.###the problem is, with a lot of it is, you have to go, you know, it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it --n4015ec, you know###.###yeah###see, and,###.###it --n4017f2's not always convenient to do it.###.###yeah,###see, and here in lubbock everything's so close.###i can imagine what it's like --n401945 up there.###.###yeah,###i'm not exactly sure where the, you know, the can thing is --n401a23,###but, you know, sometimes it's just so,
23177:30	but, um you know, occasionally we have some around,	###.###uh-huh.###.###it's not plastic.###i didn't want --n40237c to buy a plastic one.###.###yeah###because those things i think --n402423 would just snap you know.###.###yeah.###.###.###but payless cashways has them###and they're metal,###and i don't know what affiliate of payless cashways you have --n40259b up there,###but it was only like seven dollars,###not too bad.###.###oh.###i'd have --n4026f1 to check into something like that, because, i mean, we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know,
23229:34	i'm sure they're probably doing that here some.	###yeah.###.###we do a lot of recycling out there.###.###uh-huh.###.###now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard,###but that's just now come on board.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, we've been throwing paper out there away for years,###and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big earth day thing came out, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###i don't know what, you know,###i haven't,
23433:133	well, i think, i think basically we're in a lot of agreement, uh, in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs, uh, some kind of legal definition.	###.###okay,### take care.###.###all right,###.###bye-bye.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###okay, uh,### let's see,### i, i believe in the trial by jury.###i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for, uh, payoffs, you know, briberies, uh, unfairness, one-sidedness, you know, all those kinds of things.###and i also like the unanimous decision because you have --n40036e to persuade everybody --n400381 to be a hundred percent, absolutely sure before you convict somebody.### i, i really agree with the, uh, innocent until proven --n4004ea guilty theory.###i think that's, that's a good way to do it --n400600.###that's about all.###.
23443:24	maybe there ought --n400cf2 to be some kind of, of, uh, mumblex	###.###okay, uh,### let's see,### i, i believe in the trial by jury.###i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for, uh, payoffs, you know, briberies, uh, unfairness, one-sidedness, you know, all those kinds of things.###and i also like the unanimous decision because you have --n40036e to persuade everybody --n400381 to be a hundred percent, absolutely sure before you convict somebody.### i, i really agree with the, uh, innocent until proven --n4004ea guilty theory.###i think that's, that's a good way to do it --n400600.###that's about all.###.###well, i think, i think basically we're in a lot of agreement, uh, in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs, uh, some kind of legal definition.###.###uh-huh.###.###but for anything involving that, trial by jury certainly should be mandatory.###.###uh-huh.###.###but there should be with our overworked, uh, judicial system,###it seems to me like there ought --n400b2e to be a means of, of, um, not having --n400b69 to take everything before a full court. you know,
23510:57	and let's, you know, let's get rid --n402e07 of some of this harassment suing.	###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, maybe, instead of being so quick --n4027f4 to sue you, uh, if you have a disagreement with someone, instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff, maybe you nee-, maybe you,###and if you want --n402a78 to, your lawyer or your, your opponent need --n402aab to go --n402aba face this group of twenty-five or a judge mumblex like they have on t v###.###good idea.###.###.###yeah.###.###and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case.###.###yeah,###right###that's,###.
23542:16	it's in there some place.	###.###.###yeah,###that's true,###that's true, too.###but, uh, you know, that whole biblical concept like that, that's true in a lot of our,###um, you know, the, the way the whole judicial system and the government is based --n4037f8 on that --n403807.###it doesn't work on that,###but it's based --n40396a out of that.### and, uh, so that, you know, that could work,###.###yes,###i'd forgotten what that's called --n403afa --n403b01.###there's a, a real name for that like the judean law, or something like that.###.###um, what is that called --n403c9c --n403ca3.###the judeo-christian ethic.###judeo-christian ethic.###.###well, that may be right.

24192:41	and, um, i also have a good languages background, linguistics. and some psychology.	###yeah,###yeah,### i'm, i'm pursuing what they, what --n403327's, what --n40333e's called --n403351 an interdisciplinary field.###i'm a speech therapy major###.###uh-huh.###.###and fortunately i have a lot of, i have a good medical background,###.###yeah.###.###and,###.###that's probably very useful.###.###yeah,### it's, it's actually turning out --n4036a9 to be more, more useful than what i thought --n4036d8.###.###uh-huh.###.
24340:23	it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law.	### it, it was enjoyable for a while, um,###but it's such a grind###.###yeah.###.###and you begin --n405db2 to wonder, you know, if, if i'm not##, i mean, you really have --n405ec0 to be dead set on --n405edb being a lawyer --n405eee to do it.###.###uh-huh.###.###if you have any doubts whatsoever, you better not get into it.###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard,###and i aged ten years.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i, i, i wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world.

24421:47	and it, and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it.	###well,###.###.###well.###.###yeah###after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training, you know, it's, it's something, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###i think that's why, you know, children really need --n407674 to think about the field they're going to, going into --n4076bb, and i mean, spend a lot of serious reading before they, i mean, not just thinking about --n40771e.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###they actually should do some reading###.###that's right,

24443:14	there are just some people that i, you know,	###and they should study it.###.###.###yeah.###.###.### i, i, i, i think, i think there's a lot --n407c63 to be said --n407c76 for kids working after school.###.###uh-huh,###sure.###.###i mean, they, they find out whether, just how much of a people person they are --n407ead.###.###that's true,###i found that out when i was in high school --n40800d.###i worked at mcdonald's.###.###oh, and i tell you what,###i worked at mcdonald's as well,###and i, i can tell you one thing,
24454:121	i, i, i hate, um, --n408760 having --n40876b to play such a nice guy. you know, especially when it's all phony --n4087b2. especially when you got some, uh, jerk coming in --n4087e9.	###i mean, they, they find out whether, just how much of a people person they are --n407ead.###.###that's true,###i found that out when i was in high school --n40800d.###i worked at mcdonald's.###.###oh, and i tell you what,###i worked at mcdonald's as well,###and i, i can tell you one thing,###there are just some people that i, you know,###you just came to the point where i mean,###and oh, i eventually worked in a lab, in a la-, as a lab technician,###and i worked front desk.###and i mean, somebody could walk in the door,###and i knew exactly what they were going --n408594 to do --n4085a3 and say --n4085b2.###.###yeah,###yeah###i was the same way too.###i'm not a people person.
24565:28	if someone's having personal problems --n402c07 for some reason that --n402c1e's causing them to h-, behave differently	###uh-huh.###.###and from that point on, uh, at, the n c double a does have something to do --n4022e3 with it,###but it --n4023f1's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each in-, individu-, individual institution to identify the ones that --n40245c have the problem.###.###oh, i see.###so, do you...###.### and, and the ones that --n40263d test positive have --n402650 to retest after a certain period of time.###.###right.###well, do you think that should be implemented --n402792 in the work place###. you know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks --n402853 or has suspicion --n402866 that someone is using drugs, do you think they should have the right to send them --n4028b9 to be tested --n4028cc.###.###well, --n402a53 not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally###.###.###right.###.###but i think that might be a violation of someone's rights.
24580:124	and, and it's and it's based --n403044 on, on a perception that someone has --n403077 as how a drug user would behave --n40309a when some drug users behave, uh, normal --n4030c5, uh, you know.	###.###.###right.###.###but i think that might be a violation of someone's rights.###if someone's having personal problems --n402c07 for some reason that --n402c1e's causing them to h-, behave differently###.###right.###.###and their manager assumes they have a drug problem###.###.###i mean if someone assumed that of me, i would be upset.###.###right,###right.###yeah,### it, it would almost be like a, a, uh...###.###it's an accusation,
24606:24	so see i, for some reason, i've come up three times.	###.###right,###exactly.### i, i don't,### the, i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done --n403591 fairly --n40359c is if it's across the board from, from the janitors to the executive management.###.###right.###i agree with that. because i know personally myself, i've been in the same job for three years,###it will be three years in august###and i've already been drug tested --n403917 three times.###.###what type of job do you have --n40399d.###.###well, i'm an environmental engineer###.###uh-huh.###.###and i've been drug tested --n403a86 three times###and i know many people that --n403af8 have never been tested --n403b0f in their lifetime###and the company i work for --n403bd1 is sixty thousand people, plus.
24771:51	well, that's really too bad because it, it's giving some people unfair advantage.	### a-, actually i think that, i, higher level education,###i don't think there's so much of a problem there.###it's pretty much funded --n4007ce well.###there are small colleges that i'm sure --n400849 are struggling###but, uh, it's the job that the, the high school and the grade schools are doing --n400932 that i see, in a area like ours,###our school,###even a bad school is a good school up here, where, if i lived in new york city or washington, d c, uh, i would seriously consider moving if i had a child.###i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there.###but, of course, people are trapped --n400d45 economically###and they can't do that.###.###yeah.###i know down here the schools are, you know,###i don't know,###they rate,###i moved to arkansas and texas after --n400f4d living in ohio###and the schools down here rate, you know, --n400ff1 bottom ten percent across the country###and --n4010ad having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why.###because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed --n4011df, half the time the teachers don't know what --n40120e's going on.###.
24798:8	and some of the, the better parts of the metroplex, the, the suburbs that --n401f25 are richer have those kind of target schools.	###well, that was my experience going through junior high up there###when i came down south for high school --n401624 i was just repeating what i'd already done --n40164f. because we were so far advanced.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, you know, i'd been in a parochial school before junior high###and, you know, even the public schools are behind the parochial schools.###.###yeah.###.###so, you know, i, i like the concept they've got --n40195b now where they have more directed education --n40197e, you know,### you, you pick a career path###or you get counseling earlier###and then you, you learn the things that --n401ba5 help you rather than --n401bbc spending four years --n401bcf learning the same things over and over.###.###like they have that --n401d08 down there that,###.###well, they talk about it###and there are a few in some of the more, like in###i live in a big metroplex
24802:122	it's like if, if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that, there's no reason that you should take college prep courses --n40216e when you can get some general business courses in high school --n4021a1.	###.###and, uh, you know, i'd been in a parochial school before junior high###and, you know, even the public schools are behind the parochial schools.###.###yeah.###.###so, you know, i, i like the concept they've got --n40195b now where they have more directed education --n40197e, you know,### you, you pick a career path###or you get counseling earlier###and then you, you learn the things that --n401ba5 help you rather than --n401bbc spending four years --n401bcf learning the same things over and over.###.###like they have that --n401d08 down there that,###.###well, they talk about it###and there are a few in some of the more, like in###i live in a big metroplex###and some of the, the better parts of the metroplex, the, the suburbs that --n401f25 are richer have those kind of target schools.###but, uh, you know,###.###yeah,
24846:25	and, you know, there's some kids that, you know, --n403503 want --n40350e to go --n40351d learn,	###.###i think the schools today, you know, the public schools are just, they're just overrun --n402c24, you know,###they don't know what to do --n402d63,###there's too many kids and not enough teachers###and too many of the kids don't care.###.###yeah,###i find that that the, that in the, in the cities, it's more like the kids go there --n402f5b so socialize not really to learn###.###and,###.###.###right.###.###and the parents send them there because they're supposed --n403165 to,### and plus it gets them out of their hair.###and i also find that, that you can send a kid to school,###but if --n403379 don't work with them as a parent, i think --n4033b0 you're putting your child at a big disadvantage.###.###yeah,
24911:13	i can see some lady,	###.###because i know the town that i come from --n4047fe the, the, uh, the large i b m plant has something to do --n404859 with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one### and plus for, for the type of student that --n404a69's going to that school, it's going --n404a94 to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists.###.###right.###.### they're, they're, you're most likely --n404c93 to do better in school.###they're going --n404d9f to help you.###.###you hope.###.###yeah,###you hope.###well, i think,### i, i don't know.###i just think it, it's, it --n404f69's a duty of the parent to do that.###i mean, jeez, my parents always helped me###and, i don't know,###it's just like you say,###it's the way you're raised --n405212 --n405219 and the economic situation you're in --n405240.
24959:32	maybe we do, we need some more catholic schools,	### we, uh, our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many, many years just because people are, are in the recession###and they're,###even though we've, uh, enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years, now we got eight percent, uh, unemployment when it used --n4063ef to be four or five --n40640a.###people are going, whoa.###.###yeah.###.###so,###.### starts --n4065cc hitting closer to home.###.###yeah,###but i always,###see it's all, it's all money.###this,###like a couple other topics we had talked about --n40676f was crime.### it, it's, it's all money based. and what you can do --n406852 unless you just get down to the parent level### and, and then if you're in a bad situation where you have --n4069e2 to send your child to a bad school --n406a09.###who --n406b12 knows,###bu-,
24962:14	in, uh, some places, uh, you couldn't go to a public school.	###people are going, whoa.###.###yeah.###.###so,###.### starts --n4065cc hitting closer to home.###.###yeah,###but i always,###see it's all, it's all money.###this,###like a couple other topics we had talked about --n40676f was crime.### it, it's, it's all money based. and what you can do --n406852 unless you just get down to the parent level### and, and then if you're in a bad situation where you have --n4069e2 to send your child to a bad school --n406a09.###who --n406b12 knows,###bu-,###maybe we do, we need some more catholic schools,### support the church instead.###they seem --n406c69 to have done a, the good job in the past.
25010:18	uh, we also have some two year college.	###.###well that,###.###but at the same time it's really not, it's not like going to m i t.###my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of m i t.###and that's, it's really too bad###.###well,###.###but that's,###i don't know,###i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built --n407f63.###you get people out of high schools and col-, junior colleges that --n40804a don't have the background for an m i t kind of curriculum.###so,###.###so you have --n4081be to go to a lesser engineering school.###we have a very good public school up here###and a degree out there means a lot.###it's a very good school.### it's, it's university of vermont.
25071:15	and i'm not some kind of an idiot,	###.###yeah.###.###and also the, uh,###i don't know###it seems almost like there's this, it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep --n4010d0 wanting --n4010db to do it --n4010ee is so we'll look good to the other nations###because i think they, that's an area that the other nations, especially europe, look down on us like oh, we're just backward wayward children who --n401317 still use this backward system, who --n40133a haven't really attained it yet --n401359.###and i feel it's just pride of why they keep --n401568 trying --n401573 to push it on us --n40158e.###and it's like, hey, we're content with this.###no,###it's probably not as accurate,###probably, you know, intellectually doesn't,###it's not as sound intellectually,###but, like you said i mean, come on.###i had six years of college###and i don't know the metric system###and i don't care --n4019dc to learn it###.###yeah.###.
25273:85	well, um, oh, i guess another thing i've noticed --n4007f5, too, here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days, it's been awfully gray, you know, just,	###well, uh, i think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year.###.###i think that's true.### the, uh, the bermuda grass is greening up in march, and sometimes doesn't really start --n400251 doing that until the first part of april.### so. so i think we're a little hea-, ahead of schedule on that.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon,###and i noticed all that grass coming up,###and i thought, ooh,###we've got --n40060d to start this mowing bit soon.###.###that's true.###it's been a, a fun break,###but the break is over.###.###yeah.
25340:29	they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather. you know	###.###yeah,###that's true.###um, one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high.###.###um.###.###and what that tells me --n401ce4, is that the summer weather is very predictable, that it doesn't vary very much.###.###yeah.###you're probably right.###.###i mean, any other time of year, that's not the case, because it could be very warm or very cold.###.###yes,###as a matter of fact, i heard the weather the other day on t v###and i think it was one day this week a year ago###.###uh-huh.###.
25479:56	and, uh, we'll get out of the driving range and, and get some interest built --n401468 up	###so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while,###and i, i hope i'm on the right track.###.###yeah.###.### shot a career low eighty-nine,### so, and my handicap is twenty nine.###.### that's, that's great.###.###i like that.###.###yeah.###now it's, uh, like i say, it's been a while for me, too.### i, uh, i've got my wife motivated about it,###um###.###really.###.###and, uh, i think that's probably going --n401291 to be one of the next investments, is get her, get her a set of clubs
25608:31	and then, you know, we've got some guys here that --n404375 they are, you know, four and five handicappers	###.###yeah.###.###well, about,### that's, that's true of any sport, you know.###if you want --n403fa1 to play tennis, or racquetball,###.###yeah###.###.###you don't want --n40404e to go out and get beat --n40406d to death,###but.###.###right,### and, and people don't want --n404161 to play with somebody that they are going --n404188 to beat --n404197 every time, you know###.###no.###.### and, and, uh,###.
26057:49	well, having, having been out of the credit game for some years now, i've gotten used to --n4045f3 either paying in cash or not getting it.	###uh-huh.###.###um,###.###well, and you're tempted --n4040b5 if you've got cash, a little bit of cash, and you don't have enough for the purchase, right.###.###yeah.###.###of course, you got --n40424f to charge it and keep your cash.###.###sure,###naturally.###that's,###i got into all kinds of trouble --n404375 doing that.###.###what are you saying --n404407.###oh, my husband says i might buy it,###but i, i don't really usually consider that an option.###.###.
26291:55	and, and, it's, it's limited application in some respects.	###.###and get that done --n407a40 this summer.###.###uh, i'm going --n407ab8 to start this summer.###i probably won't finish it until the end of the year###.###ooh.###.###but, uh, i'm, i'm trying --n407c14 to get a, uh, intern position with i b m right now so that i can find an area --n407c73 to do my dissertation in --n407c8e.###.###because you,###.###it --n407e3c's hard finding an area --n407e5f to do a dissertation --n407e76 in this field.###.###why.###there has been so much work done already.###.###yeah,###that's,###that
26625:31	or maybe offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive to do it. uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know,	###.###yeah,###and there will be a lot of rebellion in that###and when you get people who --n4007a4 have no desire --n4007b7 to be there in the first place --n4007da, i don't think that they're going --n400805 to be serving anybody.###.###that's right.### that, that would be the problem.### sure would.###.###.###yeah.###so i think it --n400a93 would be a good thing though, to encourage other people who --n400ace aren't even aware that they can do such a thing. to get out there and do so.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,
26735:64	and, and that way, --n402f52 handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.	###i'm not even really sure --n402911 at this point in time, you know, what, what programs --n40294c are out there.###.###yeah,###and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of --n402ab1 making it mandatory, they maybe need --n402ad4 to publicize it a little bit better. and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs, and tell them that we need your help, and, you know, uh, volunteer for such and such a time,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and you've a choice of where you want --n402e6a to go --n402e79.###.###yeah.###.
26756:36	but, they would have --n40373a to be supported --n40374d in some way,	###.###yeah,###like maybe if, if there was something they could do --n4030c8 in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have --n403123 to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.###.###yeah,###in their own community,###right.###.###.###yeah,###that's true.###most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. although there are a lot of kids who --n403484 would do it --n403497 just to get away from their parents.###.###that's right.###.###.###yeah,### that's, that's true too.###that's true too.###.
26767:38	or would they really, you know, make a contribution of some kind.	###most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. although there are a lot of kids who --n403484 would do it --n403497 just to get away from their parents.###.###that's right.###.###.###yeah,### that's, that's true too.###that's true too.###.###but, they would have --n40373a to be supported --n40374d in some way,###and i'm not sure that tho-, those programs are available --n40380c to do that.###.###yeah,###yeah.###me neither.###and, you wonder, you know, what kind of quality job would they do --n403978, you know,### just sit around for their year,###.###right.###.
26819:29	and, i think, that they could get some results from that, because there are a lot of people who --n404847 are volunteer and community minded,	### it wouldn't take up much, much, it would take up more time than anything###but it wouldn't take up a lot of money.###.###yeah.###.###they wouldn't have --n404498 to spend money --n4044ab advertising and things like that.###.###yeah.###that's right.###.###you go to school###and you have a kind of a captive audience,### get them all in the auditorium,###.###yeah.###.###and you, you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something,###.###uh-huh.###.
26977:14	i've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy --n40215b	###but i had decided long before i was even married --n401898 that i wanted --n4018ab to, if possible, teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools.###.###yeah.###.###um, and my reason for that was i don't like the, uh, what's the right word --n401a96. the varied inappropriate influences that you find --n401abd so much in the public schools.###.###well, that's a nice way of putting it.###.###.###you can find a lot of good public schools if you, if you look real hard###but i don't think they could cover everything that you could teach, your children --n401e14 on an individual basis.###.### exact-, exactly,###.###.###and too, most people don't have that option.###.###yeah.###.###you know. and plus it also depends on the district you're in --n40201a as, i mean, on the,
27056:5	some of them were even better behaved.	###well, we had the problem when i was in, with --n403824 teaching, um,###i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with --n403909###and if we did have a, a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken --n403a09 out of the schools or trying --n403a28 to teach them something while they were there.###.###uh-huh.###.###and you don't know if you were reaching them or not###but we felt like, you know, maybe just going ahead and try --n403d4a to teaching them was bet-, trying --n403d6d to teach them was better than have them taken --n403d9c out.###.###yeah.###because, uh, uh, that just,###that doesn't do a lot for them.###i mean it, alleviates your problem###.###yeah.###.###but it doesn't do anything for them.###.###right.###uh, most the time if they were, they were,
27147:10	and consequently some of the very best students were, had excellent memories	###they just,###you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases###and then you get one examine for the whole semester###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's how well you can remember it all --n405b6f.###.### how, how much can you stuff --n405c0e in your brain.###.###yeah.###and i found that a particularly useless way of studying.###.###yeah.###.###i never did.###i always tried --n405dc8 to understand things, not tried --n405de7 to memorize.###.###uh-huh.###.
27330:65	i remembering --n409191 reading a few cases about that when it, when some people first tried that --n4091e0	###um, they try --n408a56 to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have --n408a95 to.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be, they're kind of monitored --n408bdd.###you know, they, they will allow you to,###i can't think of any examples###but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence.###and maybe they were a group of mennonites or something like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###i don't think they're were in this area###but, um, they, they are monitored --n409015 by the, um, by the state school board.###.###um.###.###so.###.###that's interesting.
27487:39	and, uh, and, in fact she put some right ba-,	###no,###i haven't.###.###my wife,### we, we built a shed over the long way,###actually, it took,###this is not on the topic###but i did finish it.###but my wife went to the, uh, home depot, i think it was, and, and took a, uh, a copy, took a piece of brick###.###uh-huh.###.###and she wanted --n402ffb to paint the shed### it's, it's a wooden shed, uh,###and she took it###and they've got this machine that --n40315a matches the color of paint.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, they got,
27507:15	and then they wanted some gray to do the, --n40397d to do the trim.	### and, uh, and, in fact she put some right ba-,###she got,###they mixed, uh, a gallon of it###and, uh, it --n4033e7's just remarkable how close it will match the paint --n403416, uh,###and it does it, uh, oh, electronically some, something, magic.###.###oh,###so, they did do a good job.###.###.###yeah,###you know, they,###but it's electronic.###.###yeah.###.###uh, you put your sample under this thing###and it looks at it in-, and, uh, and determines the,###and it, it's really remarkable.###uh, the problem they had --n4038ec
27683:75	but the, the interesting thing is that paint we wound up --n406ecb having --n406ed6 to go back and scrape some of that away	###uh-huh.###.###and the lights shine right at our house.###it's kind of,###we didn't know that when we bought the house --n406839###but,###.###so that, uh,###you get some,###the color doesn't really matter for, because you have that light.###.###yeah.###we have a lot of light,###yeah.###and, well, it, it, it, um, well, it's just, uh, i think it's just the, the, the dark blue to about three feet###and then above that we left it white###so. anyway, it didn't, it didn't change###.###i see.###.
27754:135	i think with, in a way one could talk about simon and garfunkel that way because they do tend, uh, --n40167d to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, uh, usually tend --n4016c0 to have some good or bad moral to it.	###.###yeah,###that was my teenage years.###i was born --n400e2b in fifty### and, and, uh,###.###okay,### we, we're very similarly aged,###so we probably have an in-, interesting perspective on the music on the times,###so i'm just a couple years older than you,###.###yeah.###.###um, essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which --n401138 meant that i, for one reason or another i didn't pay much attention to music,###but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me,###uh, my early popular music interests were in simon and garfunkel, whom i saw --n4013e4 perform when i was in college --n401403###and i became attached to that style of, uh, urban, urban country if there is such a thing,###.###yeah.###.
27773:13	i listen to some country and western	###.###i think with, in a way one could talk about simon and garfunkel that way because they do tend, uh, --n40167d to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, uh, usually tend --n4016c0 to have some good or bad moral to it.###uh, over time i became very interested in, in baroque classical###and i think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it, it very relaxing for me.###my tastes now run i guess --n401af8 to a upbeat, uh, simon,###.###yeah.###.###it's something that --n401bd1 interests me, uh, combined with, with the classical tastes i had mentioned --n401c18.###and my classical music tends --n401d33 to be confined --n401d46 to the seventeen hundreds, early eighteen hundred music.###i'm not a music, um, mumblex,###i'm not particularly schooled in it.###i know what i like --n401eef to listen to --n401f02 as far as classical music.###and i, i spent a good deal of time --n401ff7 listening also to, uh, people from the late seventies, really, um, neil diamond, for instance. um, people of, of that particular time,###.###that's kind of the way i am --n40221f.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
27780:99	but when i do play, uh, and begin --n40268e to reacquire skills --n4026a1 i inevitably fall in love with country western music which --n4026d0 tends --n4026db to be in some ways easy to play --n40270a for a, for a new piano player.	###.###it's something that --n401bd1 interests me, uh, combined with, with the classical tastes i had mentioned --n401c18.###and my classical music tends --n401d33 to be confined --n401d46 to the seventeen hundreds, early eighteen hundred music.###i'm not a music, um, mumblex,###i'm not particularly schooled in it.###i know what i like --n401eef to listen to --n401f02 as far as classical music.###and i, i spent a good deal of time --n401ff7 listening also to, uh, people from the late seventies, really, um, neil diamond, for instance. um, people of, of that particular time,###.###that's kind of the way i am --n40221f.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###i listen to some country and western###but i'm not sch-, schooled in it###and i, i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it --n4023d0.###i played a little bit of piano.###i continue --n402502 to do that.###i want --n40256c to do it###and i never have the discipline --n4025df to stay with it,

27864:37	i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes --n405531	###uh-huh.###.###uh, and my family now knows if they come into my study and, uh, i happen --n404e49 to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying --n404e84 to get a project done, uh, at school, uh, and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know --n404f0b to just stay away,###.###.###that's their signal.###.###they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it,###.###yeah.###.###that's right.###.###when did you first take your, uh, first piano lesson --n4052c2.###.###uh, probably about first grade,###.###yeah.###.###and i have, uh, returned about every four or five years to --n4053d4 thinking that i would like --n4053ef to do something about it.
27908:51	i just, you know, i can just drift off into some other world --n406c28 just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that --n406c73,	### but, but it doesn't for me.###.###.###no,###it's making that, that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it.###i was never able --n406260 to, to master all that.###in fact my brother and sister both, they were, oh, thirteen, sixteen years older than i,###they went through the, uh, parent thing where you've got --n406447 to practice or you're not going out --n40646e to play --n40647d thing,###.###.###and when it came to my turn --n4065b0 the folks said no we're not going through that again,###they sold the piano,###and is the turns out i was the only one who --n406710 really had an interest in it and never got --n40673b to,###so i,###.###uh-huh.###.###that's one of things i felt like i missed --n4068e5 in life###and i, i really,###in fact, uh, one of my favorite things to do --n406a3b now is sit down and listen to chopin, that --n406a6e is played --n406a7d on, uh, piano.
28108:162	because if, if i had been allowed --n404d27 to work, you know, maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week, i might still be working basically full time or part time, if there was, if there had been some way --n404dd2 to work it out --n404de9,	###well, still taking care of the children is a very important job.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and someone's got --n404365 to do it, and be able --n404388 to do it right,### and and if it's not mom then, then dad or somebody's got --n4044ba to move in there and do the job, because the kids really need it.###.###and enjoy it,### that's, that's the whole thing.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###i think that's the thing that we're going --n40475c to see --n40476b,###well, i think the biggest thing we're going --n404854 to see --n404863 coming up in the next ten year, even in the, even now they're starting --n4048ae to do it, but i think it's going --n4048e1 to be more in the next ten to fifteen years, is that there's going --n404928 to be a lot of women,###and they're going --n404bf5 to have --n404c04 to work it out to working part time.###.###uh-huh.###.
28274:4	some kids are really having it.	###.###they're going --n4086a3 to say to the kids you need --n4086c6 do this, because it needs --n4086e5 to be done --n4086f8 not because it's a woman's job or a man's job, but because it's dirty and it needs --n408757 to be clean.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###but i think in between we got a group of kids, a generation of kids who --n4089cc didn't learn --n4089df to take responsibility because mom left --n4089fe to go --n408a0d get a job and dad didn't move in --n408a38 to fill the gap.###and so, basically no one was taking the responsibility###.###and it's going --n408cbc to, it's going --n408cd7 to,###.###and i think that's happened in a lot of cases.###.###yeah,
28280:19	un, you know some time day care is really good,	###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###but i think in between we got a group of kids, a generation of kids who --n4089cc didn't learn --n4089df to take responsibility because mom left --n4089fe to go --n408a0d get a job and dad didn't move in --n408a38 to fill the gap.###and so, basically no one was taking the responsibility###.###and it's going --n408cbc to, it's going --n408cd7 to,###.###and i think that's happened in a lot of cases.###.###yeah,###some kids are really having it.###if they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't,###yeah,###the ones that --n408f8f are now getting --n408fa2 to be teenagers and in some cases, young college.###.###uh-huh.
28335:24	some of the, some of the women's roles, i think --n40aa4a, are almost for the worse, because we're losing out on some things, --n40aa91 going back to work,	###i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls.###.###yeah,###well, she's usually in bed by this time,###but she's staying up late tonight.###but,###yeah,###i want --n40a500 to have a relationship with her.###you know, my dad was a very traditional dad,###and when i was a child --n40a624 i didn't really know my dad very well,###and i miss that.###and i want,###.###that's the thing,### if woman's role, like we said, if women's roles change drastically, men's roles will, too.###.###yeah,###but men have --n40a907 to be convinced --n40a91a of that.###.###and a lot of it's for the better.
28335:95	some of the, some of the women's roles, i think --n40aa4a, are almost for the worse, because we're losing out on some things, --n40aa91 going back to work,	###i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls.###.###yeah,###well, she's usually in bed by this time,###but she's staying up late tonight.###but,###yeah,###i want --n40a500 to have a relationship with her.###you know, my dad was a very traditional dad,###and when i was a child --n40a624 i didn't really know my dad very well,###and i miss that.###and i want,###.###that's the thing,### if woman's role, like we said, if women's roles change drastically, men's roles will, too.###.###yeah,###but men have --n40a907 to be convinced --n40a91a of that.###.###and a lot of it's for the better.
28597:28	and we, uh, got a quote on some laser printers --n404f3f the other day at six hundred dollars.	###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, it's just so,###the budget restraints and things like that, it's, makes it difficult###and, uh,###.###they have gotten really cheap.###hewlett packard makes,###it's actually a dot matrix printer###.###huh-uh.###.###but the quality is almost laser quality.###.###oh, huh-uh.###.###and i think it's called --n404d88 the desk jet###and they're, you understand, i think they're about five hundred dollars now.###.
28711:26	and the guys that, some of the guys that --n40759a run this place are very tight	###.###huh-uh.###.###it's just the audit department happened --n406c9c to be just a little behind the times because the, uh, the senior vice president, over audits, is cheap.###.###huh-uh.###.###and it --n406e45's real hard to pry money --n406e68 out of him to, to do these things --n406e9b,###but i was, i was able --n406fc7 to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better###and,###.###right.###.###um.###.###we find it hard to believe --n407193 --n40719a sometimes, or hard to understand --n4071c1 when, uh, we work for a computer company --n4071f0, and, uh,###how are we supposed --n40737a to present the imagine that we're supposed --n4073a1 to present --n4073b0 with equipment that --n4073c3's outdated, that --n4073da's obsolete --n4073e9###.###yeah.###.

29611:17	and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of --n406e5d.	###and they're pretty close.###uh, the one that i picked --n4067be is more similar in format to the newspaper,###speakerbnan*t105-2.###.###i grew up near houston###.###uh-huh.###and there are two major newspapers --n406901 there that --n406910 run pretty much neck and neck,###.###and the one i picked --n4069d8 here had the same format as the one that my parents took --n406a0f as i was growing up. i mean, the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###it's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over --n406c4d,###and i enjoy,###.###.###the comics are better in this newspaper.###this newspaper has the far side and the comics that i enjoy --n406da3
29678:24	people say let me see some of your work.	###but, um,###.###what kinds of things have you done --n4002b7.###.###um, well, i've made a lot of baby gifts.###.###uh-huh.###.###it seem like that's,###like, especially lately there's been so many babies, that, uh,###bibs and blankets, and things like that. wall hangings, um,###.###do you ever keep any of your stuff.###.###isn't that funny.###no.###.###i do crochet and a lot of, uh, things like that,###and i have very little of my own stuff,###and it's kind of embarrassing.
29716:10	i did some needlepoint years ago,	###oh, yeah.###and it's real neat.###.### was, was the whole face --n400d4f done or just the numbers, and, and, like minute marks.###.###um, basically, the whole,###well, no,###i guess the minute marks,###but the minute marks are done --n400f3b,###they're like hearts.###.###oh.###.###and then the,###at the numbers they, they're kind of outlined and stuff.### it, it was quite bit of work,###but, you know, it was a lot of fun, too.###i really like --n401228 doing stuff like that.###so.###.
29815:13	i've seen some,	###um.###.###um. i really wanted --n402eb0 to do, you know,###so many of them now have the ribbons where, i'm not sure how they do it --n402f93 --n402f9a,###but the ribbons, they make them,###they like.###i don't know how --n403118 to explain it --n40312b.###they make them hard, you know.###.###like fabric that --n40322b's been stiffened --n40323e.###.###yeah.###.###yes.###.###i've never done that,###and those are so neat.###i mean, i would really like --n403398 to do those###but, um.###.
29839:25	there's bound --n403e36 to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that --n403e65's very similar that --n403e7c's not going --n403e8f to melt too much with, uh, uh, high humidity, in a room,	###.###.### and, and they're all a handful.###so it's got --n403818 to be something she can do --n40383b fairly easily and fairly quickly.###.###oh, definitely,###yeah.###.###when i do, um, crochet --n40397b, it's usually the lacy victorian type things like that,###.###oh.###.###and i stiffen those with a, a glue mixture.###it's like white glue,###and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped --n403b8e in --n403b99 and then, um, allowed --n403bb8 to dry in those, those draping bows, i mean, those draping streamers.###i don't know.###.###oh.###.###i was just.
30001:7	but some things, especially letters, if they suggest certain colors for letters, i just go with whatever i want --n407a78 to --n407a87.	###so it --n407201's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them.###.### do you, do you use patterns, i mean, like a book of patterns,###or do you go out an buy a, a kit, like for a bib or something like that.###.###no,###i usually just buy a pattern book.###i have several pattern books,###and i just go with those.###.###okay.###.###and then i buy the bibs separate.###usually i think it's a little bit cheaper in the long run,###and then i just use whatever colors i want --n407794 to --n4077a3.###i don't usually use the colors they tell me --n407864 to --n407873.###.###um.###.###and it, it depends on what it is --n40795e, you know.
30118:198	i know when i travel --n401d6c, or when i used --n401d8b to travel overseas quite a bit --n401daa, what i would do --n401dc9 on my american express card is before i would, before i left i would mail a check to, to american express and, you know, have some idea of how much --n401e64 was there, you know,	###uh-huh.###.###but, we use it the same way,###and, uh,###.###i find the one i use --n40180d mostly, uh,###aside from the american express, i do use my sears card.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, i try, a-, as with the american express, i try --n4019aa to pay it, you know, as it comes in.###.###right.###right.###.###so, uh,###.### it's, it --n401b95's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill.###that's usually how we do it --n401ce2.###.
30287:40	i, i've been doing it for twenty some odd years.	###.###so, when i heard that jack was going --n4049d5 to do this --n4049e8, i called him and asked for an application where i could participate in this --n404a2b.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###and, so that's how i got involved --n404bbd.###.###yeah.###you have a very, um, very,###what's the word --n404ce3.### your, your speech is very exact.###.###oh. thank you very much.###but, as jack said, i'm one of the, the old hands in the speech business.###.###oh really.###.###yeah,###uh. yes,

30438:27	and, you know, it's got some stuff on it.	###.###that's wonderful.###i have often thought that, that --n401715 having one at home would be neat.###i just don't know if we would really use it that much. you know.###.###we really,### we deci-, we didn't decide --n401929 to get one until i started --n401948 working at home.###.###uh-huh.###.### then, you know, then, we thought, well we can use it for, you know, some personal things.###we di-,###for us it --n401be1 really took, you know, a business application to justify the expense of it.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh, definitely,###definitely.###i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer, oh, i guess --n401d9b, probably three years ago for christmas,
30439:48	it's got a nice little word processing software on it, you know, and some budgeting type things and stuff.	###that's wonderful.###i have often thought that, that --n401715 having one at home would be neat.###i just don't know if we would really use it that much. you know.###.###we really,### we deci-, we didn't decide --n401929 to get one until i started --n401948 working at home.###.###uh-huh.###.### then, you know, then, we thought, well we can use it for, you know, some personal things.###we di-,###for us it --n401be1 really took, you know, a business application to justify the expense of it.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh, definitely,###definitely.###i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer, oh, i guess --n401d9b, probably three years ago for christmas,###and, you know, it's got some stuff on it.
30493:38	there are some definitely, some, some advantages to it.	###and he just ripped them off.###they go through just a continuous thing on the printer###.###right.###.###and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes###and there they went.###you know, and he said, you know, i can balance my checkbook in seconds, you know because it's all in the computer, you know.###.###right.###.###so.###.###and you know there's not going --n40309d to be those adding mistakes that we all make --n4030c8.###.###that's exactly why.### he said, you know, he said, used --n403209 to be i always sat --n403228 looking for those, you know.###he said this way there isn't any.###you know, it does it for you.###so. this, you know,
30504:13	and we have some education programs that he likes --n4039de.	###so.###.###and you know there's not going --n40309d to be those adding mistakes that we all make --n4030c8.###.###that's exactly why.### he said, you know, he said, used --n403209 to be i always sat --n403228 looking for those, you know.###he said this way there isn't any.###you know, it does it for you.###so. this, you know,###there are some definitely, some, some advantages to it.###it's just a matter of, like you say, are the advantages, does it justify the cost, if you're using it strictly for personal business.###so.###.###right.### i, i think in most cases i'd have --n4037b3 to say no.###not unless somebody really enjoys it. or perhaps is using it for education.###.###right.###.###i have a four year old son,
30596:33	i mean, and then of course you have some changes to make --n40553a, and do the whole thing over.	###uh-huh.###.###and we just had a regular old typewriter, not even a correcting one back then.###.###oh and you had --n40520e to type all of his papers.###.###it wasn't that long ago,###but i typed his master's papers and things on a typewriter.###.###.###oh gosh,###.###oh boy, to have a computer back then.###.###oh, cut your time in half at least.###.###at least.###.###at least.###.

31195:47	but, uh, still i, i questioned the ability of some of the teachers to, uh, really do a bang-up job,	###.###uh, mine are both out of school.###.###oh.###.###and, uh, you know, i, i've, in hindsight, seen some things that i wished that, you know, i had done something about --n40084f that --n40085a was, you know, within my power or, uh, you know, wish that in some ways we, as parents, had more control over what --n4008d9's happening up there, you know, type thing.###.###.###such as.###.###uh, well, just over the years there were situations that, uh, uh, --n400c57 came up that i didn't think --n400c7e were fair or handled --n400c95 correctly###or the teachers didn't seem --n400de7 to be teaching anything.###of course, it --n400e78's a little hard to tell from the information that you get --n400eb3 from your child, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.### they, they bring things home###and i was never one --n401079 to believe everything my kids said --n40109c, you know, about something.###.###.
31254:36	and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases.	###.###and i used --n4028b1 to think, well, that's wonderful.###you know, they can get a real life experience.###what i'm seeing --n4029ea now, uh, in terms of kindergarten preparedness, just from, in, in, in different preschools it's like day and night.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i wonder, how do they handle a child who --n402bed is obviously very ready and another child who --n402c14 doesn't even speak english, let alone know her colors --n402c47.###.###yeah.###.###and they're in the same classrooms.###and i guess also you're going --n402e1a to see the first of the, uh, crack kids starting kindergarten.###my god, i think it would be next year is what i'd read --n402f62.###i thought, well, how do you, how do you weed those out --n403057.###.###yes.###some of those certainly have a lot of dis-, difficulties, you know, with, uh, all sorts of things,###.###.
31271:110	are the rest of us who --n403a8e went for the big bucks, you know, staying out of, you know, where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated --n403af9 to spend some time --n403b10 teaching or something with these kids --n403b2f.	###some of those certainly have a lot of dis-, difficulties, you know, with, uh, all sorts of things,###.###.###and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases.###.###when i was listening to n p r, the national public radio --n403374,###and they've quoted statistics that i just about, my throat just about fell into my toes --n403440.###they said at the bottom of the s a t scores of graduating college seniors are usually --n40356e those people that --n403581 go into education.###.###oh, wow.###.###yes.###.###that's encouraging.###.###yes.### and i, and i, i got to --n403757 thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry --n40377e,###the people that --n403888 took, you know, the lower level courses, i sometimes wondered, you know, are they really even educatable or trainable###and it,###my god, you know, i-,
31278:24	maybe there need --n403e0f to be some radical changes made.	###they said at the bottom of the s a t scores of graduating college seniors are usually --n40356e those people that --n403581 go into education.###.###oh, wow.###.###yes.###.###that's encouraging.###.###yes.### and i, and i, i got to --n403757 thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry --n40377e,###the people that --n403888 took, you know, the lower level courses, i sometimes wondered, you know, are they really even educatable or trainable###and it,###my god, you know, i-,###are the rest of us who --n403a8e went for the big bucks, you know, staying out of, you know, where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated --n403af9 to spend some time --n403b10 teaching or something with these kids --n403b2f.###.###yeah.###.###i don't know.###.###well, that's, you know, that's an idea.
31279:10	do some things that --n403ebc are totally different and unheard of.	###.###oh, wow.###.###yes.###.###that's encouraging.###.###yes.### and i, and i, i got to --n403757 thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry --n40377e,###the people that --n403888 took, you know, the lower level courses, i sometimes wondered, you know, are they really even educatable or trainable###and it,###my god, you know, i-,###are the rest of us who --n403a8e went for the big bucks, you know, staying out of, you know, where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated --n403af9 to spend some time --n403b10 teaching or something with these kids --n403b2f.###.###yeah.###.###i don't know.###.###well, that's, you know, that's an idea.###maybe there need --n403e0f to be some radical changes made.
31317:82	and while it had, you know, a few little grammatical problems, it wasn't very long and so forth. i thought it had some nice, well thought out, uh, parts to it.	###you know, what has, you know, has, has the educational system been watered --n40473f down to --n40474e that anybody who --n404761's above average is now gifted.###.###huh.###.###i don't know.###.###that's interesting.###i don't know.###mine didn't, did not fall into the gifted category.###.###oh, don't say that.###.###nope.###and i would never had said so either.###uh, but, uh, they managed --n404b84 to get through, although not always with flying colors.###uh, in fact, one of the incidents i was thinking of --n404c8b that my son had --n404ca2. uh, he was struggling with senior english###and i had a meeting with the, uh, vice principal and the english instructor,###and, uh, she showed me a paper that he had just handed --n404ec9 in.###and she told me what she had requested --n404f91.###and i read it
31476:29	i agree that, that some innocent person might be victimized --n4018b1, by a false test,	###.###i mean i haven't had one yet.###um, t i,###i work for texas instruments###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.### and, and, uh, we, you know, we do have the random drug testing###but i've missed it so far.###but i mean, it, in the back of my mind, it always bothers me.###and what --n401366 happens if it, you know, if it, if they catch it,###they think that i'm, you know, i'm on drugs###and they send me and, and have me, uh, you know, go through this, this, thing, you know,###.###checked out or whatever.###.###yeah.###.###but it --n401778 seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that --n4017af. um,
31480:39	but i would think that, um, that some guidelines could be set --n4019cd up to avoid that.	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.### and, and, uh, we, you know, we do have the random drug testing###but i've missed it so far.###but i mean, it, in the back of my mind, it always bothers me.###and what --n401366 happens if it, you know, if it, if they catch it,###they think that i'm, you know, i'm on drugs###and they send me and, and have me, uh, you know, go through this, this, thing, you know,###.###checked out or whatever.###.###yeah.###.###but it --n401778 seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that --n4017af. um,###i agree that, that some innocent person might be victimized --n4018b1, by a false test,###.###uh-huh.###.
31489:41	on the other hand, um, i think there's certainly some professions that --n4021b6 ought --n4021c1 to be tested --n4021d4 because of the, of their responsibility for the public welfare, and certainly people in, uh, industries, well, the transportation industry, for spe-, uh, you know, specifically.	###and they send me and, and have me, uh, you know, go through this, this, thing, you know,###.###checked out or whatever.###.###yeah.###.###but it --n401778 seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that --n4017af. um,###i agree that, that some innocent person might be victimized --n4018b1, by a false test,###.###uh-huh.###.###but i would think that, um, that some guidelines could be set --n4019cd up to avoid that.###for example, that one, uh, positive would not be, uh, accepted --n401b04 as an automatic, um, reason for whatever they might be going, --n401b43 to do --n401b52 if they found a positive, uh, dismissal or treatment or whatever, but that, that what it would do --n401bbd is it would trigger, perhaps, uh, one or two more stages where further tests could be ta-, uh, done --n401c24 --n401c2b.###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###because, um, there are, there must be people like you, or in other circumstances, that --n401fb1 could come up with, with, uh, false positives for certain kind of drugs.
31533:12	and it takes some drastic steps at this point.	###.###yeah.###.###uh, number one is i, i'm, i'm kind of,###i know this sounds like a slogan for the government,###but i, you know, we are in a war against, drugs.###.###yeah.###.###i mean it's, it's horrible.###.###sure.###.###i mean, you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
31622:35	and there needs --n405b2b to be some, some measure of, uh, certainty before anything drastic happens.	###what limits --n405387 ought --n405392 to be put --n4053a5 on it, do you think --n4053c8.###.###well, the limits, uh, uh, would, i think --n4054b3, have --n4054c2 to do with what i'd alluded to --n4054e9 before, that there needs --n405508 to be a further, um, that, that one positive on a drug test, would not constitute, uh, dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might, uh, have --n4055ab set up for those who --n4055c6 genuinely have a problem.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###in other words, there needs --n405927 to be, um, more than,###.###treatment before for dismissal type thing.###.###pard-,###yes,###right,###.###yeah.###.###there needs --n405aa2 to be more than one test,
31639:85	so it seems to me that, that, um, there needs --n4063ea to be some ground, you know, some rules that --n40641d protect.	###yeah.###.###there needs --n405aa2 to be more than one test,###and there needs --n405b2b to be some, some measure of, uh, certainty before anything drastic happens.###.###uh-huh.###.###there are lots of things that --n405c79 are involved --n405c88 there, um, such as, perhaps, insurance uh, you know, denial of insurance for someone, um,###.###uh-huh.###.###and undoubtedly there are people who --n405e6d would be victimized --n405e80 by this, um, that --n405e9f would, that, you know,###it would be unfair,###and people who --n406033 are on medication, for example, or, um, even people who --n406072 might be of the gay community,###and i'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society,###but, um, i think that there doesn't need --n40624c to be fuel to the fire for discrimination###.###right.###.###because it makes a bigger problem. um,
31666:10	would be some measure of protection.	###personally, i think that's what i was about --n4067ec to say --n4067fb is that everyone needs --n406812 to be tested --n406825.###.###and,###yeah.###.###.###yeah.### i don't, i don't know why it --n4069ae would be, you know, uh, bad to test just every- --n4069ed,###.###it, you know,###.###and it --n406b6b may be, you know, it --n406b96's not feasible to do everyone,###but certainly random testing, the fact that people know that, that they,###.###that it could happen.###.###yeah,###.###uh-huh.###.
31673:65	well, there's, yeah, there, there's going --n407140 to be some measure of incentive, uh, reward or whatever,	### i don't, i don't know why it --n4069ae would be, you know, uh, bad to test just every- --n4069ed,###.###it, you know,###.###and it --n406b6b may be, you know, it --n406b96's not feasible to do everyone,###but certainly random testing, the fact that people know that, that they,###.###that it could happen.###.###yeah,###.###uh-huh.###.###would be some measure of protection.###but the bottom line is that, that if, if you're going --n406e8c to stay clean and straight, then, um, you're, you're going --n406ed3 to do that because you want --n406ef2 to.###.###right.###.###really.###.
31760:37	i told my husband, i said, you go out some to work on the car,	###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###um, it doesn't really have --n4006c1 to matter,###i mean, it could be working on cars could be your hobby really.###.###really###yeah,###i kind of enjoy --n400863 doing that a little bit, too.###.###mumblex.###.###no,### i, i guess if you make money at it, it becomes a vocation.###.###yeah,###well, i don't know,
31917:13	and we made some really nice christmas wreaths with, uh, dried red flowers and dried white flowers and, uh, eucalyptus.	###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###well, i guess we have --n403145 to get back to hobbies since,###.###yeah,###we're getting to where, we're straying --n40323d, i guess --n403254,###.###stick on the subject.###.###yeah.###.###well, interesting thing that i do --n40336c is with, gardening, uh,###my sister grows flowers that you can dry --n403436,###.###uh-huh.###.###and you can make fl-, uh, dried flower arrangements###and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun.
31987:28	you know, after a while you make some stuff,	###.###yeah###yeah.###.###but, uh, it's, yeah, i think it's the greatest stuff in the world, though.###it's, jeez,### they, i make all kinds of things with it.###we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers.### i, i almost want --n4048b6 to start a business --n4048cd doing it,###but i don't, i, i'm so, uh, timid when it comes to starting a business --n4049e9.###.###yeah,### that's, that's a big step,###yeah.###.###yeah,###it is, especially with the, being in on the creative a-, aspect and the crafty end.###.###yeah, uh,###.
32005:38	and his, uh, son built him a garage and got him some, uh, oh, i don't know what the equipment's called --n4055b1 --n4055b8, but planers and things and s-, set him up,	###yeah, uh,###.###you know, after a while you make some stuff,###then you start --n404df7 looking at it,### go, boy, this, this is kind of ugly.###.###.###but i know someone who --n404f34 does a lot of woodworking for a hobby.###um, he does it, believe it or not, i wouldn't imagine why, but to get out of the house, away from his wife,###because he's a seasonal worker,###he works in the construction.###and up here it's almost a pattern,###and you see your fathers do it,###then their sons do it.###what they do --n40536d is they work construction,###.###yeah.###.###then they get laid --n405428 off for like twelve weeks in the winter.###and, uh, this guy was going nuts,
32071:143	and, uh, so, and, uh, so as far as, you know, planting outdoor stuff, matter of fact, tonight i just got through, i was planting some, some trees out back tonight,	###.###that would be really t-, you know,###like say the,###.###.###oh, man,###yeah.###.###and it's all got --n406a9e to line up.###it's,###and, uh, i don't think he goofs too much,###i don't to, see too much scrap around.###.###yeah,###yeah,### that's, that's something.###now our temperatures down here, we're starting --n406d68 to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties###.###god, i'm envious.###.
32291:24	i made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe,	###uh-huh.###.###and sometimes i, i want --n400f38 to plant something,###there's not enough room to plant. some of those things like, uh, you know, the things that --n40102c vine like, uh, cucumbers, or, uh, squash or something, like that. plant one of those###.###that's right.###that's right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.### takes a lot of room.###.###and it takes up your whole space.###.###it sure does.
32577:19	next year i was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called --n405996 cabbage, --n4059a5 cabbage loppers, or whatever.	###.###uh-huh.###.###i don't really like --n4055f1 to put a lot chemicals on it###but then, again, i don't want the bugs eating it upping either.###.###right.###.###.###right.### i, i,###it seems like they come in spurts.###.###uh-huh.###.###one year i didn't put anything on###and i didn't have any problems.###.###uh-huh.###.
32577:41	next year i was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called --n405996 cabbage, --n4059a5 cabbage loppers, or whatever.	###.###uh-huh.###.###i don't really like --n4055f1 to put a lot chemicals on it###but then, again, i don't want the bugs eating it upping either.###.###right.###.###.###right.### i, i,###it seems like they come in spurts.###.###uh-huh.###.###one year i didn't put anything on###and i didn't have any problems.###.###uh-huh.###.
32704:46	when we had our pool done --n407766 --n40776d i had them to leave some extra loam, you know, for my garden	###.###but, uh, you know, you can improve your own soil there###.###uh-huh.###.###but the texas soil isn't the greatest, gardening soil.###.###that's right,###.###.### you, you have --n407495 to work on.###you, really do.###.###right.###.###.###and you know, if i, i didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow###you know what i mean --n4076b8.###.###that's right.

32983:19	mumblex and i've got some tomatoes still growing, in, in containers,	###i've never done potato.###we used --n40b04f to do it at home when i was a kid, had a huge garden --n40b092.###.###oh, the potato,###.###.### they were, they're delicious###but they,###you don't get, seem --n40b250 to get that much for the space,###.###uh-huh.###.### they, they do.###.### it takes a, yeah, it does take some space.###.###some beet, uh, potatoes###.###yeah.###.

33143:60	but there's, uh, they're a pain to peel --n401f76 for some people.	###.###and you're not supposed --n401984 to eat those because they're bad for you.###.###okay.###well, i'll remember that.###.###yeah,###so if you ever go in a restaurant, order crawfish,###i mean, every once in a while you'll see on-,###i mean, it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident###but if the tail is straight on it then, yeah, don't eat it.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, you just put some cajun, well, lots of pepper###.###uh-huh.###.###and you just boil them###and they're absolutely wonderful
33291:14	make hot dogs or some potato chips	### and and we threatened --n40471f to make the other two uh make us dinner one time uh just --n40475a to even it out since we seemed --n40477d to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying###.###uh huh###.###.###that sounds right### i would i'd take him up on that###.###i'm###.###.###it does###except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just --n404ac6 to uh make sure that they didn't have --n404af5 to do it again###.###.###uh huh###.###.###i'd be###.
33345:49	one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings	###uh-huh###.###i don't know what she calls them --n40583d in### i don't i'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol###but###.###.###um###.###.###i don't know### i would i would be interested in --n405a6a getting that recipe for you if you have it around###.###yeah### it's um it's in the other room###i don't know if we have enough time for it###.###oh###.###it's real easy
33466:11	i got some interesting information about crawfish	###.###sure.###.###and have --n407c95 to take'em out --n407cac to eat###right now i'm taking a class on ettiquesy and all the little bitty things that i didn't even know --n407d84###.###oh###.###.###really###.###i mean i thought for sure i'd been raised --n407ea6 properly###.###.###but i've been doing a lot of things --n407f68 wrong i didn't know about --n407f8b###.###.### but um so is there anything else###.###well i i think we've covered the subject
33627:34	i was off for about six months too just for some other surgery i'd had --n40297d,	###and, uh, i was on crutches,###and he said, i think you better call an orthopedist.###so we went to one###and he just put a big old cast on it.###.### put a big cast on it.###.###yeah,###for about four weeks.###.###four weeks,###yeah.###.###well, i like aerobics,###but i'm not so sure that,###.###well not that much, though.###.###no,###i've never,
33859:9	there some things i'd like --n406b30 to try --n406b3f,	###and he goes, human nature.###.###.###and then, you know, you see these little girls in these little bitty things,###and they're all like twenty-one years of age.###.###uh-huh.###.###but luckily at mumblex there's a little more diverse clientele.###.###that's true,###they do.###.###except for the guys that --n406963 lift the weights.###they do intimidate.###.###yeah.###i try --n406a36 to go real late or real early before they get there.###.###yeah.
33871:11	there was some girl there.	###.###except for the guys that --n406963 lift the weights.###they do intimidate.###.###yeah.###i try --n406a36 to go real late or real early before they get there.###.###yeah.###there some things i'd like --n406b30 to try --n406b3f,###but, you know, sometime when i ask --n406bf8, i just feel like, boy, am i stupid or what.###.###uh-huh.###well that's one thing i like --n406d43 about the spring creek place.###at least the fellow that --n406dfd's there, one of the fellows that --n406e24's there at night and on weekends is real helpful.###.###uh-huh.###.###and his name is b j.###.### i don't think i've ever, i think i've,
33943:27	they tried --n4087db to put me in some kind of immobilized walker, because he doesn't like --n40881e to put casts on when it's warm --n408845.	###uh-huh.###.###and they're going yes.###but in general i like to exer-, i, i like dance a lot,###so i mean aerobics is something i'd hate --n408198 to give --n4081a7 up.###but he, he kind of said something --n40828a to me about probably not as bad as your foot,###but he just said to me, maybe you ought --n4083ae to try bicycling###or,###.###yeah,###you probably will for a while, because it's going --n4084b3 to be real tender.###.###he told me eight to twelve weeks.###.###uh-huh.###.###not anything, you know.###i said, but you're only going --n408666 to put the cast on for a couple of weeks.###he said, yeah,###but that's just,
34073:121	because if, if you're going --n402176 to go --n402185 buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, i think you, you're going --n4021d8 to have some idea as to what you're going --n402207 to do --n402216 with it.	###and you can get them really cheap.###.###i know### i, i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in, uh, tennessee. and, uh, they had a waiting period###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, we bought it there.###and,###.###how long was the waiting period out there --n402002.###.###about nine days.###.###huh.###that wasn't too, too bad.###.###no.###no.###.
34149:38	you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition.	###.###do you belong to a gun club###or you.###.###he belonged to one awhile back.###uh, since we moved,###we've only been here in texas for about a year###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, we can't even find a place to shoot --n403a66. just for target practice.###.###no kidding.###.###i'd love --n403b66 to get used to that shotgun.###we traded his pistol for that shotgun.###.###huh.###well the, the, uh, clubs that we've got --n403c9b around here are kind of expensive###but, uh, it's well worth it.
34218:39	but, uh, i think there ought --n405f1e to be some rule against it.	###he broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things i'm sure, --n405765 being, mister cowboy.###.###wow.###.###.###i can't remember what the na-, the term --n40588b was --n405896 going around.###it was about four or five years ago.###.###.###but.###now, i guess that would be a good idea.###.###about, uh, private citizens selling a weapons.###like if you wanted --n405af0 to sell your pistol to me.###how do you feel about that --n405b9d.###do you believe there ought --n405c0e to be legislation guiding the, uh, buyer and the seller.### and, or do you believe that you ought --n405d1b to be able --n405d2e to sell your system, uh, because you own it.###.###.###uh, that's a hard one because we did that.
34322:32	i can, i can buy some, uh, today if i wanted --n40831a to.	### that's that's a little bit extreme.###but they could know anything and everything about you.###and, uh, i'd like --n407d05 to have my gun.###if they go to --n407d99 banding, banning them, i'd lose my gun###but we wouldn't lose our pis-, our, uh, shotgun.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, we're wanting --n407f5f to get a couple of more that no one knows about --n407f92.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i don't, i don't, uh,###.###do you find it --n408126 difficult --n408131 picking up, uh, guns that, that --n40815c are not registered --n40816f.###.###no.###.###no.###i don't either.
34501:47	but it was on a higher level, you know, where there were some things that kids didn't understand --n401f4b that adults did --n401f5e --n401f65,	###.###oh, well, then it won't be too bad.###.###so, yeah.###.###you know, it wasn't impressive necessarily,###but it was better than it could have been.###.###right,###right.###and i was impressed with the fact that, um, it wasn't that childish.###.###yeah.###.###you know what i mean --n401c9a.###it wasn't,###my daughter's five,###i mean she understood everything.###she goes to almost all movies --n401de7 with us except, you know, r rated.###and she really enjoyed it,
34613:31	and there were, there were some definite, um, should i say --n40453e, tense moments, with him in there.	###.###right.###.###but he wasn't there yet.###.###right.###.###and you could tell it,###and i guess that i thought --n4040a5 was a real good acting and writing job both --n4040d0, you know, because i think, or directing job.###i think they did a real good job of that.###.###uh-huh.###.###and james woods, i think --n40430b is who it was --n404322, did an excellent job as the cop.###i mean, you know, he just,###.###yeah,###i like him.###.###yeah,
34858:123	see, that's the one, that is the honest to god the one reason i don't want --n40879e to see the movie --n4087b5 is because i love buffalos for some weird reason,	###.###but, oh,###.###you think my daughter would like it.###.###oh, well there are, there is one spot that --n408254 was just a little bit on the gory side.###.###oh, okay.###.###but, um, it's it's###.###she doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes --n408441.###.###okay,###no problems.###.###.### it, it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide, the hides --n40858d.###so there's,###.
35085:21	you know, you watch some of the cartoons,	###.###right now we don't have cable.###.###right.###.###and it --n402860's surprising how much it's changed --n402883###.###uh-huh.###.###the whole moral situation, everything, is just gone one whole complete direction different.###and we don't have any kids yet,###but i feel the same way.###it --n402a81's really tough to find something --n402aa4 that --n402aaf's going --n402abe to be good and interesting for the kids. even, even cartoons,###um###.###right.###.###.###oh.###.
35130:35	i sit, i sit and watch some shows,	###that's right.###.###i don't understand why, first of all, the public puts up with it --n4037bb. second of all, why the networks think that, you know, we enjoy that kind of stuff --n403812.###.###well, that's true.###.###it --n4039da's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that.###that can't be the problem.###.###uh-huh.###.###it must be the marketing pressures,###and, you know, their demographic studies that they do --n403bbe that --n403bc9 show, you know, that everybody's i q has dropped dramatically or something.###.###i'm glad you said it###and i didn't have --n403dab to.###but that, that, that's the,###i feel the exact same way.###.###.
35159:12	or there was some other,	###yeah.###.###i know,###i'm trying --n40421d to think if there's anything i do --n404248,### you, like, uh, i like stuff that --n404326's on great performances,###and, i, we used --n404410 to watch mystery --n404423 quite a bit and things like that.###.###okay.###.###stuff i guess --n404536 that --n404541 mostly public, on public t v.###.###right.###.###as a matter of fact, you know when i was a kid --n40464c, excuse me, my parents used --n404673 to have,###we had this rule --n404796 in our house for every hour of regular t v that we watched --n4047d5, we had --n4047e8 to watch an hour of public t v.###.###now there's an idea.###.###that was just the rule.###and if they saw us watching the, something, they'd say, all right, what did you see --n404a26 on what --n404a35's new,
35565:48	and, uh, if i consider --n403c77 going the used car route and save up some money, i shouldn't have too much trouble at all.	###that's right.###.###but it's still in great shape.###i have a mazda r x seven.###.###well, what you can do --n4037fd is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years###.###uh-huh.###.###and when you're ready --n403948 to get another car --n40395f just pay cash for it.###.###yeah,###i just about could really because i think my car,###.###yeah.###.###if i continue --n403b23 taking good care of it, it's going --n403b4e to hold a pretty good resale value###.###oh yeah.###.
35576:25	and i was picking up, uh, some background noise,	###yeah,###i just about could really because i think my car,###.###yeah.###.###if i continue --n403b23 taking good care of it, it's going --n403b4e to hold a pretty good resale value###.###oh yeah.###.###and, uh, if i consider --n403c77 going the used car route and save up some money, i shouldn't have too much trouble at all.###.###yeah,### i, i would think that's true.###.###could you hold on for just a moment.###.###sure.###.###okay.###i'm on a cordless phone,
35674:29	and so she's going --n405a11 to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try --n405a58 to make as much down payment as possible --n405a7f to keep the monthly payment low.	###but, you know, that's a sign that i'm going --n40556f to have --n40557e to do something sooner or later.###.###right.###what kind of car is it --n4056ab.###.###it's a, a buick century.###.###uh-huh.###are you going --n4057a7 to trade it in on this new one###or,###.###no,###my fiance is selling, uh, a nineteen seventy-eight cutlass supreme that she has --n4058ae.###it's actually, in better condition than my car.###.###okay.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
35674:45	and so she's going --n405a11 to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try --n405a58 to make as much down payment as possible --n405a7f to keep the monthly payment low.	###but, you know, that's a sign that i'm going --n40556f to have --n40557e to do something sooner or later.###.###right.###what kind of car is it --n4056ab.###.###it's a, a buick century.###.###uh-huh.###are you going --n4057a7 to trade it in on this new one###or,###.###no,###my fiance is selling, uh, a nineteen seventy-eight cutlass supreme that she has --n4058ae.###it's actually, in better condition than my car.###.###okay.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
35954:144	i mean, i've always felt that people on welfare should be required --n401daa to spend at least part of their time, not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job, but at least some of their time to look for, --n401e59 to go out and clean up the roads. you know,	###that's good.###.###yeah,###i guess.###.###yeah,###that's, uh,###i don't know.###there's other kinds of service to the country that --n401aaf could be done --n401ac2, you know,###.###yeah,###i mean if you don't like,###.###i mean, working in the national parks, uh, working, clean up the roadsides###.###sure.###.###.###exactly.###.
36064:49	i think, i think there ought --n4045b2 to be some kind of assistance as far as, uh,	###.###this is ridiculous.###.###it's sad.###.###it is,###it's pathetic.###i mean, there's got --n40413a to be a different way.###there's got --n4041e0 to be a better way.###but it'll never happen.###i mean, these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###what --n4043ca would happen if the mumblex required young people to do service to the country,###what should they get --n4044c8 in return, i wonder --n4044e3.###like, uh,###.
36312:38	i think youngsters ought --n4092ed to go out and do some public service,	###.###it'll be a tough road, though.###.###yeah,###i mean, here it is --n408ea6,###and we've got, we've got --n408f25 to go into partnership with the japanese --n408f48 to build cars.###.###yeah.###.###you know. and they only did it because they, i guess they were embarrassed that they're so good at it.###.###yeah.###.###.###that's about right.###.###gosh.###yeah,###well, back to the original subject,###yeah,

36988:175	in his, in the congress they, they gave him more power as far as his republic in russia is concerned --n4015c5, which --n4015d4 is, gives him more power overall, which i think --n40160b is a good sign that there will be some, you know,	###so, as soon as they get their, their own home country taken care of --n4006da, then they'll consider, what they can do --n400709 with the rest of the world.###.###.###i believe communism is very much waning.###it's, uh, pretty much on the way out of the door, insofar as the strong hold that they used --n400947 to have --n400956,###and the russian people are all realizing that the communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world,###and their rebellions right now is the result of that.###if they can get the army, or the military to sway to their side, i think that, uh, --n400c67 it will be on the way out eventually.###.###.###it's just a matter of time, because, in the baltic states they have already massacred so many people who --n400df8 protested,###.###.###and that hasn't set too well with their diplomacy for the, regarding the, uh, outcome of their affairs.###what's your synopsis --n401020..###.###well, i do, i do realize that, uh, uh, the bush administration isn't too happy with, with how they're handling their internal, uh, strife --n4010fc, you know, as far as diplomacy is concerned --n40112b.###i think it's been a good, a good positive direction for uh, the soviets as far as yeltsin is concerned --n40134f.###you know, he was, uh, allowed --n401477 to,### what, wh-,
37224:9	but in some ways i think we are expected --n40173a to do it all.	### and, and i, you know, i still provide most of the things that --n40107c go on around the house.###.###right.###.###so, uh, yeah###and for a while i was going to school too,###and tha-, it was tough.###.###yeah,### i uh, i think that while it --n40133a's a good change for i think women to be able --n40136d to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel, you know, their expertise may be --n4013b8.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i think sometimes other things suffer###and tha-,###i think it --n401657's hard to find a balance there.###.
37263:24	i mean, i've done some of both.	###uh-huh.###.###uh-huh,###not people that --n4020a8 are, you know, necessarily good friends, even though that has happened too, uh,###.###yeah.###.###it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence.###you know w-,###if you decide --n4022e4 to go back to work then you feel like you are always having --n40231f to defend yourself.###.###right.###.###and if you don't then, sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon --n402474 by people that --n402487 go back to work and so you're just wasting your time, at home.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###it's a tough one.
37283:73	but, uh, even now, i would, i would like --n402c71 to not have --n402c84 to work in some ways.	###i mean, i've done some of both.###.###uh-huh.###.### i, when my kids were real little --n402771, i was at home for a couple of different periods of time.###.###uh-huh.###.###oh, i think the longest was less than a year,###but still at least i was able --n402979 to, to spend, you know, those first months with them.###.###right.###.###but, uh, i mostly went back to work because i was tired of --n402ae3 doing without things.###.###yeah.###.###you know, the money was the issue.###.###.
37349:44	i, well i see, i think --n4046da some people wanting --n4046ed to stay home more and take care of the children.	###i just,###i know it's going --n403d7f to be a slow change.###uh, i, i feel as though a lot of people are going back to --n403e59 just having a one wage earner.###i mean i'm just thinking of my circle of people that i know --n403f9b.###i know quite a few people who --n404076 have decided --n404085 to not have both, both, both, uh, couples, you know, both, uh, of the parents work.###.###yeah.###.###and yet, uh, i, i we-,###i hope --n404348 to see employer based, you know, helping out. you know, child, uh, care centers at the place of employment and, and things like that, that --n4043d3 will help out.###.###uh-huh.###.###what do you think --n404594,###do you think we are, setting a trend.###.###i don't,###.###.###yeah,
37616:97	it seems that what you really need --n4071fd to do --n40720c --n407213 to win though, is to have a team that --n407246 has reasonable talent and has some people that --n40726d have, have, have real breakthrough years.	###do you still keep up with them, or someth-,###.###yeah,###oh yeah,### i, i definitely do,###in fact i've got family that --n406434 still lives up there.###um, from what i hear --n4064f4 from everybody up there, they're not going --n40651f to have a good year because they let too many people go.###but i've been following spring training###and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far.###.###well is that a good indicator.###.### that, well it can be.### it, it really kind of depends on, on, um, what they were, you know, what they were looking for --n4068e9.###in other words, if, if in spring cra-, training they were looking at all their kids, like a lot of them do, um, then it really doesn't give you any indication.###but if they were, uh, playing the people that they're going --n406c8f to play --n406c9e, then that might be pretty good indication,###so, you know, it's, it's not a great indication because there have been teams that --n406e18 have just, you know, come out and just won all kinds of games in spring crani-, training and then gone on a, you know, fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season###so,###.###you know what i think --n40712b is remarkable is, uh,
37768:13	'cause i did some teaching part-time	###okay,###we're going --n400038 to talk about the public school system, what --n400063's wrong with it, an, or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do --n4000b6 about it, what --n4000cd should be done --n4000e0 about it.###.###okay.###.###.###fantastic.###well one thing that --n400302 pops into my mind real quick is, uh, about the, uh, funding of, the, the school system right now.###.###yeah.###.###evidently, uh, that's, that's a big problem.###.###yeah,###it's amazing, uh,###i always thought that teachers never got paid --n4005d3 nearly enough, i mean, to be doing what they're doing --n400612, uh.###.###right.###.###when i was in college --n400758 i, i enjoyed teaching,
37798:92	what --n401193 gets me is i can't believe that congress, uh, or, our state legislature can't come up with, uh, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school --n401236.	###.###yeah,###they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week, i'm sure --n400bb4, because they've got --n400bcf to grade papers and get class stuff ready.###.###do,###right.###.### and, you know, and they're being paid --n400d7a, probably half what most people being paid --n400da1 --n400da8.###.###exactly,###and,###.###and we're paying basketball people, you know, millions of dollars a year for, for what, you know.###.###that's right,###and then they, uh, poof it off, you know, do like tarpley.###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, i mumblex
37846:61	not if you can read or write, or do, or un-, understand some science.	###.###right.###.###what's that going --n401cde to be like --n401cf1.###are they going --n401d6e to be taught --n401d81 nothing,###or they going --n401dfc be taught --n401e0b something,### we're going to, we're going --n401e97 to be involved in our child's education.###we're going --n401f97 to be teaching him what we can --n401fbe at home, of course, because, uh, i guess we don't trust the school system, which --n40201d is very sad, uh,###.###right.###.### but. but if it doesn't start at home, it's not going --n402206 to go anywhere.###.###exactly.###.###.###right,###that's true.###.###you know, and we're going --n40236a to try --n402379 to teach him good values, because, you know, we-, when, when they get to upper level school --n4023e4 and they start --n4023f7 teaching them, well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what --n40243e's important --n40244d.
38055:13	and i process some ratings and put, do graphics for their television stations, mumblex their clients,	###i don't,###i have one at, uh,###the company i work for --n40013a furnishes,###so i can work at home.###.###oh, wow.###.###and it's just an old, old compact, that --n400267 is super slow### and, but it does, it does its job,###so.###.###what processor does it have --n400419 in it.###.###um, i don't know,###it's so old.###it's one of,###.###oh what kind of work do you do --n400584 on it.###.###um, i do, um, television ratings
38063:54	it's basically just data entry and running, you know, some, some software	### and, but it does, it does its job,###so.###.###what processor does it have --n400419 in it.###.###um, i don't know,###it's so old.###it's one of,###.###oh what kind of work do you do --n400584 on it.###.###um, i do, um, television ratings###and i process some ratings and put, do graphics for their television stations, mumblex their clients,###.###oh, okay.###.###so.###.###yeah.###.
38309:21	i had --n404cd4 to do some of my husband's papers because i had access to one	###it's not.### it's, it's not pocket change,###so it's major mumblex.###maybe when the kids get in school --n4047c9 that will be, you know,###when they start --n404895 needing something --n4048a4, you know, then that will be different###but,###.###yeah,###when i started at, uh, t i --n4049d9, i was a summer development student, and finishing up at school###.###uh-huh.###.###and so those papers really,###i mean, it --n404b41 was nice having access to the, equipment --n404b6c to, uh,###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###yes,###i remember that.
38411:53	and i've got lots of documentation i need --n406c88 to review --n406c97 and some i need --n406cb2 to revise --n406cc1.	###they only come out four times a year,###so###but.###.###yeah.###boy###i tell you if i could bring a computer home and do stuff here, i'd get all kinds of stuff done --n40692a.###.###oh.###.###phone's always ringing###and, people always asking me --n406a9d to do something else.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###i've got a lot of,###especially right now, we've got several new products coming out,
38581:37	but that has a little bit --n401820 to do with some of the things that i read --n40184f.	###.###well, um probably the best one that i, i know of --n4010b0 and i work with --n4010c7 all the time is called --n4010e2 search for significance by robert mcgee###.###um, that sounds good.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's one that we use --n4012c9 in our work.###it's probably one you'd find --n401378 in like a christian book store.###i don't know what the chains are --n401451 down there.###maybe in the mall family book store, something like that.###.###uh-huh.###i'm writing it down.###that does soun-, that's sound really good.###um, what kind of counseling do you do --n40169e,###or should we stay on the topic of books.###.###um, probably should stay on the topic,
38592:10	right now some of the things i'm working with --n401b9b are kids that --n401bae are dealing with sexual abuse,	###maybe in the mall family book store, something like that.###.###uh-huh.###i'm writing it down.###that does soun-, that's sound really good.###um, what kind of counseling do you do --n40169e,###or should we stay on the topic of books.###.###um, probably should stay on the topic,###but that has a little bit --n401820 to do with some of the things that i read --n40184f.###.###mumblex.###.###i'm a therapist for rossa.###it's a christian treatment organization###.###oh.###.###and because of that i see, uh, work with adolescents specifically,###so i see a lot of kids with, with various problems.

38978:27	and i thought i better --n402e8d do some simple things and work up to this because it --n402ec0 was just so difficult to get it done --n402eeb.	###i though, oh, this won't take long at all.###but i was wrong.###.###uh-huh.###.### it took, it took a while to do --n402949.###but, it was fun,###i enjoyed it.###.###yeah.###the first project i started out --n402aae one was a big one,### it was, uh, it was of a lady###and she was kneeling,###and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe.###.###oh my gosh.###.###and i,###it was just too much to start with --n402d1f.###and i still haven't finished it, because i, i stopped,

39062:42	i guess if i had a house i might enjoy gardening, some.	###well we,###.### i like --n40415f to, i like --n404176 to do, uh, stuff with plants.### i like, um, i have a lot of plants in my apartment,###and i've got a pretty small porch,###but it's, it's, uh,###i've got a few planters out there that i, i'll, uh, you know,###in the winter time i usually plant some pansies in there,###and then in the summer i'll plant petunias, or something that --n404628's colorful###and like, that blooms a lot.###but haven't done that yet.###.###uh-huh.###.###i kept --n4047b6 thinking that it was going --n4047d1 to get cold one more time,###but i think we're probably past that now.###i probably should go --n404935 buy some.###.###yeah.###.
39130:54	so. i think it --n4060a2 would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch.	###uh-huh.###.###and my other two pots are,### they're kind of, they're pretty big,###and i have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area,###so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood, there's no room for much else.###.###.###but my dad, uh, my dad used --n405b5e to grow tomatoes and things at the house.###and i'd, i think when i was real little --n405c61 i probably had a finger in on that every time he did it --n405ca0 and had --n405caf to be out there and watch and that type of stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i've never really tried anything like that since then.###.###well, i considered it last year and this year both,###but i haven't done anything about it.###.###uh-huh.###.
39190:38	i'd love --n407305 to have, have some animals.	###so, they're pretty content now,###but they were mad at me for quite a while.###they went and hid after they, after they got dried --n406ed8 off.###.### sulked for a while,###huh.###.###yeah.###.###well, i like animals,###but we don't have any yet.###we have a nine month old with another on the way###.###uh-huh.###.###and we thought, well maybe when they're a little bit bigger --n40718c then we'll,###.###yeah.###.###or get into a house with a little more space.
39408:26	and then i mix up, uh, some cream cheese and a little bit of amaretta wi-, and some cool whip,	###uh-huh###that's what i've got --n401b92.###i've got steamed broccoli down on mine.###.###well, i just, i just don't think you can go wrong with something like that.###.###no,###it's great.###i've got a good dessert recipe.###.###oh, what.###.###uh, do you like angel food cake.###.###yes.###.###i just break it up in a glass bowl,###.###uh-huh.###.
39408:58	and then i mix up, uh, some cream cheese and a little bit of amaretta wi-, and some cool whip,	###uh-huh###that's what i've got --n401b92.###i've got steamed broccoli down on mine.###.###well, i just, i just don't think you can go wrong with something like that.###.###no,###it's great.###i've got a good dessert recipe.###.###oh, what.###.###uh, do you like angel food cake.###.###yes.###.###i just break it up in a glass bowl,###.###uh-huh.###.

39593:56	we might try --n404d58 to, to, um, to grill some flounder or salmon steaks.	###just plain yogurt.###it gives it a little tang.###.###i'll bet that is really good.###.###it makes a great sandwich.###.###man,###i'm going --n40493f to have --n40494e to think of that.###we're getting company tonight,###.###oh, are you.###.###and i have been debating what --n404a9b to cook --n404aaa because one of my guests is a vegetarian.###.###oh, yeah,###that's kind of hard.###.###so, we're going --n404c22 to,###i think we'll try --n404c95 to do something a little bit,
39625:37	sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips, just over it, and some red onion slices, and just a little bit of, um, basil, and then a little italian dressing over it.	###.###and, um, definitely go with, it will have --n405088 to be a rice dish lots of vegetables, to make up for the lack of meat.###.###right,###uh-huh,###that sounds good.###.###.###right.###i had a recipe from that, um, international cookbook two, that --n4052ac's a great salad in summertime.### do you, do you garden or not.###.###no###we don't,###our next door neighbors do###and some, a lot of times they'll give us something.###.###okay.###mumblex it's just sliced tomatoes###and i put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty.
39653:15	and you can put some cucumber slices on too.	###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###okay.###.###and everybody loves it###and it's so easy,###and it's delicious.###.###that's what i was just thinking --n40595d,###it doesn't sound like it, it would be hard at all.###.###huh-uh,###it isn't.###.###where did you get,###.
39712:12	i stir fried some the other night though.	### i've been, i've been wanting --n4065c2 to get those because we eat a lot of chicken,###.###uh-huh.###we do too.###.###and we do eat a lot of pasta.###.###yeah.###.###so, we, we just said the other night it --n4067f8 wouldn't be too difficult to be, to do without red meat.###.###that's right.###i don't think it would.###.###you know, we don't have that much of it now.###as long as we have plenty of vegetables, and lots of chicken.###.###uh-huh.###.###.
39753:27	cause, we have some, some local ones.	###.###uh-huh.###.###and at least cook a couple of dishes ahead.###.###right.###.###so that we can have those to enjoy --n40741c.###.###uh-huh.###.###so,###.###one of my daughters sent me a colorado cook book, put out by the junior league of denver.###.###uh-huh.###.###have you ever seen any put out by junior leagues.###.###yes.

40634:72	she gets home visitations by the s-, mumblex i don't know, the state boards, i guess, some of them and then some by the association,	###in plano.###.###plano.###.###yeah,###and they have a number you can call --n4053bf###and all these people are registered --n40544a with their association and, you know, go like### our, our, uh, i don't want --n405532 to call her a baby-sitter, she's doesn't like, --n405569 to be called --n40557c that,###.###.###care provider.###.###care provider.###.###right.###she goes to seminars###and, uh,###.###oh, that's wonderful.###.
40634:87	she gets home visitations by the s-, mumblex i don't know, the state boards, i guess, some of them and then some by the association,	###in plano.###.###plano.###.###yeah,###and they have a number you can call --n4053bf###and all these people are registered --n40544a with their association and, you know, go like### our, our, uh, i don't want --n405532 to call her a baby-sitter, she's doesn't like, --n405569 to be called --n40557c that,###.###.###care provider.###.###care provider.###.###right.###she goes to seminars###and, uh,###.###oh, that's wonderful.###.
40694:58	and he just really missed --n406e3a being able --n406e49 to be by himself, and having some peace and quiet	###.### and, uh, and then he'd get on the amrein's bus --n406822 to go to amrein's###and then there would be a whole ton of other kids, all in the same room, you know,###.###yeah.###.###you know what fun they had --n406a25 with these computer games###and then they'd go outside for awhile,###they had snacks and story time and everything.###but, it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able --n406bd5 to get home at two thirty.###.###poor kid was in school all day.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###because he was always around with a crowd of kids###
40705:25	we all need that time, just some quiet time --n407079 to wind down from the day --n407098.	###poor kid was in school all day.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###because he was always around with a crowd of kids######and he just really missed --n406e3a being able --n406e49 to be by himself, and having some peace and quiet###.###uh-huh.###.###or, you know.###.###uh-huh.###even at that age they need that time,###.###yes.###.
40951:7	and some of those other places i wouldn't have.	###.###uh-huh.###.### and, you know, and there were places that --n40a98f were cheaper,###.###uh-huh.###.###but is it,###.###no.###.###you know, your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money, you know,###.###yeah.###.###and i have peace of mind, where he is --n40abeb###.###.###uh-huh.###.
41388:61	i think there was four or five different people, that --n406c71 would call, you know, some of them, if they didn't have their addresses and all on them,	###.###no.###.###like, they just###whoever, --n406831 wanted --n40683c to come.###.### what they did --n4068b7 was, well, see what they did --n4068e2 was, okay, they, uh, they wrote to all the initial people, you know, the, the oldest ones.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###okay,###then those in turn got a hold of these other ones.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they had like,
41527:40	it has everybody that you could ever imagine --n409348, and some you couldn't --n40936f.	###.###i bet.###.###course we've got, we've still got it###and they charged us, i think it was like, it was like --n408e7c five or six dollars, i can't remember exactly, you know, that we paid --n408ec7 for the book to be printed --n408ee6.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###and it's not, uh, it's not a hard back book,###it's just a, oh, like a, you know, folder type thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###but it has the entire, you know,
41566:22	i just remember they had some funny stories,	###i don't know if you're like me,###but i know very little about before my grandparents.###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, very, very little about it.###.###i just,###the thing is i know a lot of stories,###but i can't remember who it was about --n409a53.###my grandparents told us when i was growing up --n409aeb and even when i was an adult --n409b0e###they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends, cause they all grew up in new york city,###but i can't, you know, i remember these stories###but i have no idea who it was --n409e00 that --n409e0b was in those stories.###.###yeah.###.###so, i mean, i couldn't give an accurate,###i couldn't tell my kids what, you know, those people were like --n409fb2,
41569:76	maybe what you could do --n40a177 if you couldn't get into a full family reunion, and you wanted --n40a1b6 to go back some,	###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, very, very little about it.###.###i just,###the thing is i know a lot of stories,###but i can't remember who it was about --n409a53.###my grandparents told us when i was growing up --n409aeb and even when i was an adult --n409b0e###they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends, cause they all grew up in new york city,###but i can't, you know, i remember these stories###but i have no idea who it was --n409e00 that --n409e0b was in those stories.###.###yeah.###.###so, i mean, i couldn't give an accurate,###i couldn't tell my kids what, you know, those people were like --n409fb2,###i just remember they had some funny stories,###but i don't know who it was --n40a0f8.###.
41573:26	but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents --n40a313, then you can find out from, you know, you can find somebody else that --n40a35e can tell you something else about these,	###.###i just,###the thing is i know a lot of stories,###but i can't remember who it was about --n409a53.###my grandparents told us when i was growing up --n409aeb and even when i was an adult --n409b0e###they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends, cause they all grew up in new york city,###but i can't, you know, i remember these stories###but i have no idea who it was --n409e00 that --n409e0b was in those stories.###.###yeah.###.###so, i mean, i couldn't give an accurate,###i couldn't tell my kids what, you know, those people were like --n409fb2,###i just remember they had some funny stories,###but i don't know who it was --n40a0f8.###.###maybe what you could do --n40a177 if you couldn't get into a full family reunion, and you wanted --n40a1b6 to go back some,###.###uh-huh.###.
41652:11	but, for some reason a mini skirt is, to me a little more unprofessional to wear --n401b72 to work than jeans	###.###yes.###.###.###and i think that does make a difference,###because when you do have --n401550 to be in front of people --n40156f, uh, i think --n40158e you, the, the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and, and, uh, more classical style of clothing.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###what about the mini skirt.###.###there are a few people --n401894 every now and then that --n4018af wear those to work.###they're pretty strict about that, though.###um, i've never worn,###i just wouldn't,###i mean even to,###well jeans aren't exactly professional
41675:11	there are some that --n40235d are really short	###i don't know,###i wouldn't want --n401eb7 to wear a mini skirt to work.###.###we-,###.###i have seen a few people do it though,###but they, they weren't overly shor-,###and they weren't overly revealing.###they were pretty much in good taste,###but, um,###.###uh-huh.###.###for me i just, i just, cou-, wouldn't want --n4021b2 to do that.###.###well there are mini skirts###and there are mini skirts.###.###yeah.###.
41676:16	and then there are some that --n4023e8 may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee.	###i wouldn't want --n401eb7 to wear a mini skirt to work.###.###we-,###.###i have seen a few people do it though,###but they, they weren't overly shor-,###and they weren't overly revealing.###they were pretty much in good taste,###but, um,###.###uh-huh.###.###for me i just, i just, cou-, wouldn't want --n4021b2 to do that.###.###well there are mini skirts###and there are mini skirts.###.###yeah.###.###there are some that --n40235d are really short
41717:66	well i feel like too, on the job, when, you know, there's men around and some of the managers are men --n403282, you just, you know, you don't want them looking at your legs necessarily.	###.###uh, even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through, uh, grandmothers, in my class.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, whe-, i always try --n402c84 to emphasize the, clothes that you wear --n402caf should not necessarily be the greatest fad,###.###uh-huh.###.###because maybe they, those are not the clothes that --n402e29 are the most, uh, appealing to you, or the most, uh, complimentary to you.###.###right.###.###but, uh, the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want --n402ff6.###.###right.###.### and, and then, uh, then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy --n403111.###.###uh-huh.
42132:18	the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas, you know.	###.###yeah,###and those kind of people, i'm sorry, you don't reform them, you know,###.###no,###i don't think,###.###i really beli-,###you don't.###.###huh-uh.###.###if they're the kind of people that --n404808 commit these, excuse me, grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again, you don't reform those kind of people.###.###huh-uh,###and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me.###.###no,###no,###and i don't know,
42149:6	some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do --n405104, it's just, it just gets out of hand,	###no,###no,###and i don't know,###the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas, you know.###.###right,###yeah.###.###well, if you're insane enough that you can go --n404c17 cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard, then are y-, can, can you be helped --n404c96, you know,###.###.### i have, i have my doubts, you know.###.###that's right,###yeah,###yeah,###i do too.###.### i, you know, i don't know,###i think there's a point,
42183:38	uh, i can't remember what the town was --n405845, some little area.	###no,###huh-uh.###.###mayb-,### it was, i think it was the south east area, from dallas.###.###oh, really.###.### my daughter, my daughter lives down in rowlett###.###yeah.###.###and she was telling me about it.###.###oh really.###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.
42470:35	but somewhere we've got --n40b2db to come up with some money to build, --n40b30a to build more, you know, and keep these people in them, you know.	###uh-huh.###.###and we're going --n40ab56 to have --n40ab65 to say, if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime, you are going --n40abc4 to be sentenced --n40abd7 to death period, period,###.###yeah.###.###and do it, you know.###.###yeah.###.###and if you commit this crime, you will be in prison for the rest of your life.###.###right.###.###we're not going --n40af2a to say we're going --n40af49 to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years,###we're really going --n40b0bc to do it, you know.###.###.###it's just the system has just,### an-, and i understand they're doing it because the prisons are full,
42507:27	because there has got --n4007f1 to be some kind of background check to see, that the people who --n400834 are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose, you know,	###well, i'm kind of leaning towards, i don't know, i'm thinking about what, from one to ten what my no would be --n400110.###it would probably be somewhere closer to, uh, less control because i don't see,###i'm not a member of the n r a although my, father is.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, i guess i believe, i think the n r a has gone overboard the wrong way. you know,###.###yeah.###.###they're sitting there on number ten,###they're saying absolutely no gun control,###we don't even want --n400698 to think about it###.###.### and, and i think that's a dumb, situation.###.###yeah.###.
42622:71	and, i guess i think, the other thing that we ought --n402d10 to control --n402d1f to some extent is, there should be some law against the types of gu-,	###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###i was watching a,###.###gosh,###if i was a cop i would be,###.###worried about that.###.###too many people have too many, too much access.###.###yeah,###they do.###they do.###.
42622:94	and, i guess i think, the other thing that we ought --n402d10 to control --n402d1f to some extent is, there should be some law against the types of gu-,	###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###i was watching a,###.###gosh,###if i was a cop i would be,###.###worried about that.###.###too many people have too many, too much access.###.###yeah,###they do.###they do.###.

42645:119	i mean, there are a lot of kids who when they're ten --n4035c1 --n4035c8 look like they're twelve, or fourteen or, and, and, especially some of the minority children. whether, you know a racist or not,	###.###right.###.###basically it says here buy me and go --n4030ea rob a seven eleven###.###right###or even even the um the little um toy guns look real.###i mean###.###yes### they that's really gotten bad###.###i've heard so much about that on tv###and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for --n403402 holding one.###.###or your child accidently.###.###yeah.###.###if your child is old enough,
42653:25	and, and if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be --n4038f4 and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands	###.###yes### they that's really gotten bad###.###i've heard so much about that on tv###and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for --n403402 holding one.###.###or your child accidently.###.###yeah.###.###if your child is old enough,###i mean, there are a lot of kids who when they're ten --n4035c1 --n4035c8 look like they're twelve, or fourteen or, and, and, especially some of the minority children. whether, you know a racist or not,###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's the truth.
43046:79	it would be an interesting, it --n40ab75 would be even more interesting you, you to be some of these people who --n40abbc are at the other end of the spectrum.	###yeah.###.###well,###.### guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years.###.###yeah.### really does.###well, do you think we've,###.###yeah,### i, i think that's about all i can,###.###me too, on gun control.###.### we, we're in pretty good agreement --n40aa23 actually on it.###.###yeah.###i think we are.###.
43163:42	this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt, and some saint augustine.	###as far as i can tell it hasn't killed anything it wasn't supposed --n401784 to --n401793.###even the area of the grass that --n40188f was underneath and around the mounds it didn't kill it.###.###yeah.###.###.###really.###well, that's pretty wild.###yeah,###we used it for fleas.###we had fleas in our yard real bad last year,###and we did that um,### i just, i'm not,###basically, i like --n401bc6 to mow the lawn, believe it or not,###but i sometimes have problems --n401ca3 starting the mower,###so a lot of times i won't get out and do it,###but my husband, basically, does most of it,###and he does the, you know, edging and all that kind of thing,###and we're renting,###and so we don't really put a lot of money into the, uh, you know, like
43407:11	i know some friends who --n401313 went --n40131e to see it.	###yeah.###there're several of them that --n400e04 are out right now that i want --n400e27 to see --n400e36.###uh, dances. uh, silence of the lambs.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh, i'm, i'm afraid --n400fcd to go --n400fdc see that one.###that one looks so scary just, from the previews.###.###.###i thought gosh i'd probably have nightmares for the next six months.###.###nay.###.###it's supposed --n4011fd to be good though.###.###nay.###that's what people said --n4012a3,###.
43559:43	you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things --n4042c7.	###.###oh, the book is really good.###i mean, i, i keep a little library of books that i just like --n4039c3 to read --n4039d2 over and over again###and that's one of them.###.###wow. huh.###.### it's, it's so well written.###.###huh. well, i have one i bet you haven't seen --n403c4f if you don't have kids. otis and milo.###.###oh, you're right.###i haven't.###.###oh, that is, that is the most precious movie.###it has, w-, to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen --n403f1d in your life.###and it's all this,###it's the story of this little cat and dog###and it's not like cutesy.### it's just, uh, it's just so realistic. everything they do --n4041b3.
43642:11	what are some other ones i've seen --n40575f lately --n40576a.	###.###when i was a little kid --n40537e, i saw the incredible journey on christmas eve###and it was so good that i had forgotten that it was christmas eve.###.###oh, boy.###.###.###huh.###.###i mean that's something for a kid.###.###that's pretty good.###.###.###really.###.###and that was something for greedy old me at christmas time,###i'll tell you.###.### let's see.
43673:87	i just go --n4060bb to be entertained --n4060ce and and not really interested in some of the, like the terminator or some of the schwarzenegger stuff.	###.###yeah.###the first one was really good.###but the second one, is really good too.###.###.###i was really surprised.###.###yeah.###i didn't much care for the first one.###maybe that's,###.###no,###i thought it was funny.###but, that's my sense of humor.###.###well, i, i'll have --n405d58 to go --n405d67 get that one i guess --n405d86.###.###it --n405e67's hard to find movies that --n405e8a aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore.###and i'm just, i guess i'm just middle america or something.
43815:11	there's some nice stuff --n408515 over there to see --n408534.	###i mean, the whole thing was about the size of a, a medium house.###yeah.###it wasn't,###.###oh, really.###well, when i was in england years ago --n4081b8. and i went to, to like shakespeare's and, you know, stratford-on-avon and all that###.###oh, yeah.###.###and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it because it was so short.###.###yeah.###.###the ceilings were so short.###.###yeah.###.###but. yeah.###.###yeah.
43837:14	here's --n408a42 some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field.	###yeah.###.### i, i spent four years --n4085fb traveling around and didn't see, you know, hardly anything.###i just,###.###oh, boy.###.###i need, --n408770 to go over there and stay about twenty years so i can just travel. go around all the places.###.###.###yeah.###.###stonehenge, of course, you know.### every, everybody makes the obligatory trip to stonehenge.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###okay,###big deal.
43900:8	probably some of them did.	###that sounds great.###.###.###yeah.###.###uh, but other than that i just didn't have time to go to the movies --n409771, you know.###.###yeah.###.### never sho-, any, anyway, anything that i ever wanted --n4098b4,###i rented a lot of videos.###.###uh-huh###.###cause the closest movie theater was barry saint edmunds###and who --n409a5c wants who --n409a6b wants --n409a76 to drive twenty miles --n409a8d to go to the movies.###.###oh, boy.###.###.
44014:28	it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles, on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front	###exterior.###.###exterior,###yeah.###.###yeah.###uh, interior's not so bad because it's more fun,###it's more, c-,###but yeah,###.###yeah.###.###outside you have high peeks, and those kind of things,###.###yeah.###.###it can be a real issue.###.###well, when we've painted --n4010d9, um,###right now our house doesn't have --n40116c to have the same kind of exterior painting there,
44014:64	it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles, on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front	###exterior.###.###exterior,###yeah.###.###yeah.###uh, interior's not so bad because it's more fun,###it's more, c-,###but yeah,###.###yeah.###.###outside you have high peeks, and those kind of things,###.###yeah.###.###it can be a real issue.###.###well, when we've painted --n4010d9, um,###right now our house doesn't have --n40116c to have the same kind of exterior painting there,
44033:5	some of the home builders are,	###right now our house doesn't have --n40116c to have the same kind of exterior painting there,###it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles, on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front###.###uh-huh.###.###so there isn't as much wood that --n4013d8 has --n4013e3 to be painted --n4013f6.###um, but, i-, it,###the problem is that it hits, the sun hits it.###so preparing is a real problem,###.###uh-huh.###.###you've got --n40165d to prepare it well###or else it will flake.###.###uh-huh.###.###um,###.###here they,
44070:32	and we have, we have some more that --n40239e need --n4023a9 to be done --n4023bc,	###yeah.###.###and,###.###yeah,###which --n401f3e might be a bigger problem than it would be, uh,###.###oh, sure.###.###yeah,###absolutely.###.###so y'all, you haven't had any, any jobs painted --n4020a1 in your house or recently mumblex.###.###no,###we've have, uh, done a little painting ourselves, um,###we painted the bedroom, uh, well within the last t-, couple of months,###.###that's fun.###.
44092:7	and some of still has --n402f9b to be redone --n402fae.	###uh-huh.###.###but the, the problem that we've, we've owned this house almost five years now,###and, um, when we bought it --n402606 the, um, it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired, mumblex###but the daughter was a real estate agent###and she was selling it###and it's been lived in --n40280c briefly by her before she bought her town house.###so she told us that the house had been, uh, professionally painted --n402906 recently.###and it looked pretty good, you know, the, uh, the interior walls all basically white,###but they obviously had been done --n402abb without to much, uh, wear afterward.###the only problem was when we started --n402b90 having the movers move the furniture in --n402bb3 we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood-, uh, the door frames,###.###uh-huh.###.###when we took the masking tape off --n402d89 half the painted came with it.###.###uh, that's not very,###.###big long strips.###so what --n402ebc had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly.
44119:16	so we still have some of that trim work to do --n4037bc because we put it off all this time,	###.###well, no###actually it had been, uh, it would have been, it had been a repaint job.###.###um.###.###but they had not,###either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top###or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they,###because it was woodwork###so it looked as if it had been painted --n403467, correctly with, you know, uh, an enamel or something,###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, it had not, either that or it had not been prepared --n4035c6 underneath###and it was greasy or something,###.###sure.###.###it comes off in strips, i mean not even little bit.
44504:75	are you willing --n408e35 to compromise a little and, and pay, pay some, take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education.	###it may be free###but is it good education###and that's just it###are we willing --n4086a4 to pay for it, you know,###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all###but, so are they willing --n40884b to, pay for, you know quality education, you know.###.###uh. uh-huh.###.###.### so, you know, and yet they, yet people get very frightened when they see the japanese moving in --n4089c8 and the russians moving in --n4089e3 certain areas of technology, you know, that we use --n408a16 to dominate --n408a25 --n408a2c###and it's like well, you know, they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do.###so, you're going --n408d44 to have --n408d53 to expect it.###so what you,
44694:37	uh, and, and, you know, some people might not believe that	###.###i mean she really could pick up on my mood uh, the way i walked in the door --n403f43.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###it was, uh, uncanny.###.###huh.### i, i think, uh, in a way we're able --n4040f8 to read each other pretty well because, uh, she knows when i'm upset --n40413f and i know when she's not feeling good --n40416a too.###so. i know like when she has an accident --n404356,###i know she's not doing it on purpose.###.###yeah.###.### when when she was younger --n40449f, she used --n4044b2 to do that --n4044c5 to get even with me,###.###yeah.###.###.
44710:12	well, for some reason during the night, the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through	###.###yeah.###.###.###uh, and, and, you know, some people might not believe that### but, but, but, uh, i do.###.###sure.###oh, absolutely.###.###like if i, if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours, uh, because i was going out. she would, uh, break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to, uh, to, to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did --n4048ee.###.###really.###.###yeah.###.###that's the way,###well, i had that cat that i mentioned --n404c57, alfie.###one morning, you know,###the first thing you do --n404d54 is you get up and you, you, you feed this cat some-, something and, and you make sure that it can get to its litter box.
44903:37	and ma-, maybe let them have some mock, i mean uh, you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start --n401592 really young.	###.###.###and i think it does.###we vote every time.###.###well, it, uh, there's no question###it does make a difference.###uh, so far, as having a party and then all voting, uh, when you have different precincts --n400f84, mumblex you would have --n400f9f to have a party in every precinct.###.###.###right.###.###because people have --n401127 to vote in different areas###and, uh, not everyone votes at the same place.###.###.###uh, i, personally, think that we need --n401245 to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up, with the idea of the, the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference.###but,###.###right.
44939:18	and people are finally taking some action against it.	###.###right.###.###.###how to say no to it and what have --n401d48 you --n401d53.###that,###uh, perhaps we'll finally get the youth weaned --n401e46 off of it.###but, uh, i know i, i spent thirty-four years in education here in the dayton area###.###.###and in nineteen fifty-one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana, giving away their heroin and what have --n40206e you --n402079, --n402084 to get them started --n40209b.###.###um.###.###and, you know, that was in fifty-one.###that's forty years ago that it was already a problem.###.###god.###.###so it's now, uh, to the forefront
44952:36	i mean, i'm sure you heard about some of ours.	###.###and, you know, that was in fifty-one.###that's forty years ago that it was already a problem.###.###god.###.###so it's now, uh, to the forefront###and people are finally taking some action against it.###and the thing, we've, we've neglected the value of voting. and uh, and what it --n4024d0 really means --n4024df --n4024e6 to vote###.###right.###.###and we also don't make the, uh, the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them --n4026a3.###.###yeah.###well i don't know how it is --n4027c9 up there###but down here, louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all.###.###uh-huh.###.
45036:13	and you have some success and want --n404918 to go on --n40492b learning and continue --n40493e learning, uh and not wait until they're in high school	###.###tha-,###.###he needs your vote###just like he needs everybody else's, you know.###maybe if they were brought --n40434f up that a way, like you said, it would.###because i know here, uh, until you get into high school###now then they had the voting machines###and you voted for like cheerleaders and different things like that###.###yes.###uh-huh.###.###but they should start that a lot earlier.###.###yeah.###i,###it's the same way with everything in education though.###it should begin and right down in the first grade.###uh, and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first, second or third grade. so that the children develop good learning patterns
45067:40	and, okay, this, this candidate tells you some things that --n405666 are going --n405675 to happen	###.###right.###.###.###and perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run --n405082, uh, that only the most wealthy can do so.###.###right.###.###and they're not always the best person for the job.###.###right.###.###but they have the money to be able --n405292 to do it --n4052a5.### so, uh so that there are a lot of problems along that line also.###.###definitely.###.###and perhaps the government,###.###you know a good i-, idea for the young kids like that too, is to have like a a mock one.
45071:17	and this candidate tells you some things.	###and perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run --n405082, uh, that only the most wealthy can do so.###.###right.###.###and they're not always the best person for the job.###.###right.###.###but they have the money to be able --n405292 to do it --n4052a5.### so, uh so that there are a lot of problems along that line also.###.###definitely.###.###and perhaps the government,###.###you know a good i-, idea for the young kids like that too, is to have like a a mock one.###and, okay, this, this candidate tells you some things that --n405666 are going --n405675 to happen###.###sure.###.
45097:7	now some people object during primaries, --n406251 having --n40625c to declare a party, whether republican or democrat	###.###uh-huh.###.###if they did something like that and started kids out --n405aa4 real young and showed them, okay now you're not going --n405adb to get --n405aea to vote###but you're going --n405c20 to have --n405c2f to do what that person says --n405c4e,###.###yes.###.###they would understand probably by the time they were in high school --n405d49,###.###right.###.###they'd be ready --n405e11 to vote.###.###that's right.###and i think, you know, that's an excellent idea.###they would put them --n405f72 to realize that, that they're going --n405f99 to have --n405fa8 to do what someone else says --n405fc7 even though they didn't vote for it. and that maybe they need --n406006 to think twice about --n40601d voting.###.###yeah.###.
45110:199	and, uh, i do think more needs --n4068b4 to be done --n4068c7 along that line to help to, uh, teach the people, uh, uh, everyone, uh, more about what --n406942 is going on with voting and with nonvoting. so that, uh, we can make, they're making some more intelligent decisions.	###.###that's right.###and i think, you know, that's an excellent idea.###they would put them --n405f72 to realize that, that they're going --n405f99 to have --n405fa8 to do what someone else says --n405fc7 even though they didn't vote for it. and that maybe they need --n406006 to think twice about --n40601d voting.###.###yeah.###.###now some people object during primaries, --n406251 having --n40625c to declare a party, whether republican or democrat###.###right.###.###and you do that in the primary.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and i don't know that, uh, a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason.###uh, they can declare anything they want --n4064f9###and they can actually rig it.###if they really wanted --n4065dd to vote republican, they could go in the primary and say they were voting democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the republican could beat --n40665c.###but, uh, it's, uh, it's just a sad situation
45397:14	i mean, some maybe	###i do, too.###.###.###yeah.###.###but i think it really helps them to understand when, when they go to other people's houses --n4034e2###and they have pets,###i see so many times kids just, you know,###they, mean to animals --n4036c7 not really understanding that the animals have feelings.###.###yeah,###exactly,###that or, or, uh, the other extreme,### they're, they're terrified of them###and i hate that,###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###and they shouldn't be,
45790:32	now, they've been able --n40131c to get some good players and come around	###.###yeah.###yeah.###i like --n400ba4 to watch them, too.###they're the,###i like --n400c60 to watch almost all the football###but, um, of course, i watch every saints game that i can watch --n400d10.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i think they're going --n400de7 to, i think they're really going --n400e12 to do good because it seems like they're finally all coming together.###.###yeah.###.###if they would just quit --n400fde blowing it.###.###well, the,###it,### the, the n f l draft really seems --n4010ce to be doing its job###because, got teams like, like buffalo who --n4011b3 weren't, certainly weren't a powerhouse, uh, ten years ago.
46132:24	if you get --n407839 to watch some of these,	###.###yes.###.###we beat buffalo in, in, uh, was it --n4074ea third of december.###and, it was sunny and forty-five degrees.###.###oh, my goodness.###.###so, we couldn't a done much better than that in buffalo.###.###no.###because usually it's snowing.###.###yeah.###.###ice and rain and everything.###.###sure.###.###but, i tell you what,
46244:16	some, some places do have guard gates that you have --n400c65 to get through --n400c78, or electronic access gates and things like that.	###sure, go ahead.###.###uh, in dallas there's definitely a crime problem,###i know it's, you know, worse in the larger cities.###um, it's kind of a concern for me,###in fact, at the moment i'm thinking of --n400357 possibly moving to a new apartment###and, uh, it's,###i am single and female,###you definitely are going --n4004b4 to worry about the location, and, uh, you know, accessibility --n4004f3 of people to be able --n400512 to break in.###i live on a third floor now,###but, i, you know, i'm real concerned that i, i don't want --n400708 to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that --n40074b,###and, the, um,###.###do they have many buildings that --n400940 have security there.###.###some buildings do,###it depends on the location.###the area i live in --n400a60 right now, is, is real good as far as crime rate is concerned###and we don't have anything at all,###no burglar alarms, no guards.
46328:7	and some of those people, they don't deserve --n4026f6 to be let --n402709 loose.	###uh-huh,###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i, i really think that we're, we're falling by the wayside with --n402230 not incarcerating these people.###.###oh, i agree.###i think that people are getting off too easy.### they're getting, they're getting paroled --n402439 too easily.###.###uh,###uh.###.###they're just getting, uh, put --n40252a on probation or something, because the prisons don't have enough room###so they get, they get lighter sentences,###.###yeah,###exactly.###.
46373:50	sometimes when you lose someone that you really love --n403a74 --n403a7b, you do some crazy things	###uh, that's terrible.###.###and the man said, that, you know, if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail, that he would eliminate this person himself. and then go to mcdonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing, think a thing about it.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###and i mean, i think that what this is going --n4034f1 to lead to --n403504 is people will take things into their own hands. and that innocent people,###.###yeah.###.### i, i shouldn't say innocent, because i mean, ac-, actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances###but,###.###uh-huh.###.###the reasons that they're doing it --n403894 compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it --n4038cb, you know, it's like two different things.###.###yeah.###.
46441:47	i went to the far east, uh, back in october --n40523e to do some training for t i	###.###uh-huh.###.###like you take asian countries, or, uh, the eastern countries where women are like in the foreground, uh, in the background and the men are in the foreground --n404c4e,###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's like, you know, um, they live back in whe-, where we came from --n404df5 two hundred years ago.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, whe-, we've advanced beyond that,###and i think that their, uh, mentality as far as the way they treat them --n40504d and that kind of thing,###you know what i mean --n405165.###.###uh-huh.###it was amazing
46446:10	uh, some of those countries were so safe, it was unreal.	###uh-huh.###.###and it's like, you know, um, they live back in whe-, where we came from --n404df5 two hundred years ago.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, whe-, we've advanced beyond that,###and i think that their, uh, mentality as far as the way they treat them --n40504d and that kind of thing,###you know what i mean --n405165.###.###uh-huh.###it was amazing###i went to the far east, uh, back in october --n40523e to do some training for t i###and i,###.###uh-huh.###.
46609:15	and especially not in some of these big cities,	###uh-huh.###.### an, it, an i feel bad for the policeman, because he's out there every day facing these people. this, this craziness, you know, people with, uh, automatic weapons and, uh, all this other stuff and trying --n4088d5 to do a job###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###and let's face it,###what do they get paid --n408b93.###.###right,###not much.###.###twenty thousand dollars a year, if they're lucky.###i wouldn't do it for that.###.###yeah,###huh-uh,
46853:11	there's some kind of problems.	###.###and then i could, i could upgrade now if i wanted --n40444c to###but i just, i,###it's just such a huge expense### and, and, uh, i, i'm just going --n404613 to keep --n404622 holding off###but i'm definitely going --n40471d to look for something, uh, in the, you know, nice, perpor-, you know,###.###sports car.###.###.###i'd like --n404883 to have a sports car too,###but it's not practical for me,###but,###.###yeah.###i'm in,###are you still there.###.###yeah.###whoops.
46965:16	but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel,	### they're, they're cute cars.###.###yeah,###well, he did, he had a, a red miata,###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, he actually,###they came out with a european racing, green, uh, miata that --n406162's a limited edition,###.###oh.###.###they're only going --n406243 to make like three or four thousand.###so, he went out###and he traded the other one in and got this one,###.###wow, i haven't seen those.###.###and i'm like, um,###but, uh, i haven't seen one yet either
47147:12	and there's some real nice ones in arkansas.	###.###.###okay.###.###all right.### what, uh, what kind of camping is there --n400075 in texas.###.###well, there, there are quite a few, um, parks, i guess, state parks,###and there's a couple of national parks, i guess --n400273, that you can camp at --n400292.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, most of them have pretty good facilities.###i don't know if the camping that i've done --n40042e is really roughing it without a, a whole lot of stuff.###.###yeah.###so, you do, uh, like backpacking and the like.###.###uh, done a little bit of that, mainly just, um, like camping out at the state parks,###i've been to a couple in texas
47182:40	so, i'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting.	###.###yeah,###they've got, uh, real nice lake system, and, around their parks.###one of them, uh, the gray, i think that's one of the ones we've been to --n400c29, it's real nice there,###a bunch of lakes around it,###there's a golf course and, um, just a whole bunch of camping sites.###.###yeah.###.###what about you,###where have you, uh,###.###oh, i've been camping for years, not on a regular basis###but, uh, i first started --n400ff8 camping out in the desert in california. and then sometimes in the mountains also in california###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, then i moved to north carolina###and i, i didn't camp for a long time,###and then i started --n401257 to, uh, go --n401272 camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting,
47226:12	and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although, i don't think raleigh, i don't think the state of north carolina takes,	###are you kind of away from the blue ridge mountains,###.###well, it, it's, uh,###.###an area.###.###actually the, the blue ridge in virginia are closer to raleigh.###they're about three hours away if you go due north.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, of###the blue ridge in north carolina i think are much nicer###and you can pick those up --n401fbd going west,###but then you're talking about six to eight hours.###.###yeah.###.###the way it works --n4020e1.###but, um, it's a real, it's a real nice place to go and camp --n40218b,
47262:53	the, uh, the movie, the doors, has so-, some nice desert scenes,	###.###.###it's really, really nice.###um, i like it better than almost anything i've ever done --n402abe.###just the sky is so amazing.###you know, you really can probably count thousands of stars,###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it's, it's just kind of nice.###i like the, uh,###i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which, uh, a lot of people don't realize --n402df7,###you know, they hear desert###and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry, and lack of water,###course it, it has all of those qualities###but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find --n4030e9 anyway else except in a desert.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, it's pretty nice.
47270:33	i mean, it's just almost surreal, in some places.	###.###and, uh, it's, it's just kind of nice.###i like the, uh,###i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which, uh, a lot of people don't realize --n402df7,###you know, they hear desert###and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry, and lack of water,###course it, it has all of those qualities###but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find --n4030e9 anyway else except in a desert.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, it's pretty nice.### the, uh, the movie, the doors, has so-, some nice desert scenes,###those guys all go --n40335c camping out in the desert.###.###yeah.###.###of course, they drag a lot of drugs with them###but, um, the, uh, the shots are, are pretty nice###and it's sort of like that,
47420:60	and i never had --n40175d to watch the news not, you know, not like some people hour and a half a day or anything.	###.###i know###so, i felt kind of sorry for him.###mumblex###that must have been hard on him because he's just a person###but, um, i never mumblex,###a major owner of our t-, of the team here.###.###oh, really.###i didn't know that.###.###yeah,### he's like, i thought he was the owner###but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner###but he must own the biggest chunk###because that's all you hear about --n401509 is, if, you know, about neal bush i think is his name.###.###uh-huh.###.###see, i even know his name because he's on the news a lot,
47430:120	speaking of bush, we're going --n401ac8 to get a little off topic but speaking of bush, they that had a story where he went --n401b23 to visit some little, uh, elementary school students, and stuff --n401b5e.	###.###yeah,### he's like, i thought he was the owner###but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner###but he must own the biggest chunk###because that's all you hear about --n401509 is, if, you know, about neal bush i think is his name.###.###uh-huh.###.###see, i even know his name because he's on the news a lot,###and i never had --n40175d to watch the news not, you know, not like some people hour and a half a day or anything.###.###yeah,###and i've been watching, uh,###my husband's french###and so if i've been watching the french news, when i watch it --n4019a8.###.###uh-huh.###.###it's incentive,
47531:17	so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this iranian, mumblex with baseball tickets,	###we got free tickets because someone at our church, one of the deacons at church, um, parks cars at the mansion at turtle creek which --n403107 is like one of the, uh, the places and stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###and he's their head chauffeur, is this funny, as they're parking the cars the valet service.###.###right.###.###yeah,###he makes good money too --n403450 doing that,### you'd be sh-, i was shocked --n4034da,###but anyway, someone gave an iranian a tip of four rangers tickets last year,###.###uh-huh.###.###and then the iranian couldn't,###he didn't want them,###so he gave them to alan,###and alan and his dad had plans that night###so they gave them to us,
47593:18	then my father got us some tickets,	###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and if there's a game on, he's watching it.###i mean, that's all there is --n4047dd to it,###.###really.###.###and he's like glued --n4048b1 at the t v.###.###i'm glad my husband's not like that.###.###oh, i'm glad my husband's not like that either,###i'd kill him.###my brother's like that###and, um, see he goes to a lot of games,###not a real lot,###but he tries --n404bce to go,
47855:7	and some of the people in our church use birth control	###.###but, um, then you didn't believe me about her kids### are the they are so good.###i'm not kidding you###but she does work with them###and it's a commitment###and, that, that's what they're called --n409f67 to do --n409f76.###.###uh-huh.###.###i have a,###most of my friends,###.###i admire someone that --n40a0e2 can do that, you know,###i really can.###.###i know,###i do too,### i, most of my friends have three or four kids###and they feel like, you know, that's really why god mumblex
47856:7	and some of them don't,	###but, um, then you didn't believe me about her kids### are the they are so good.###i'm not kidding you###but she does work with them###and it's a commitment###and, that, that's what they're called --n409f67 to do --n409f76.###.###uh-huh.###.###i have a,###most of my friends,###.###i admire someone that --n40a0e2 can do that, you know,###i really can.###.###i know,###i do too,### i, most of my friends have three or four kids###and they feel like, you know, that's really why god mumblex###and some of the people in our church use birth control
48103:10	they need some attention.	###and so, he thought surely that i, or i would have bought a hot line, --n40486d to know if he ever skipped school, which, of course, --n4048a8 was not the case###.###oh.###.###.###and i wouldn't have checked on him.###however, uh, there are, there are, points both directions in that, uh, from the standpoint of parents working and not working.###.###yeah.###.###uh, i listened to more than one parent say i don't know what this child wants --n404c6f.###i'm working two jobs,###they each have their own television,###they each have their own telephone,###they each have their own rooms,###they each have this,###they each have that.###i'd say, but what they don't have --n404f5b is you.###.###that's right.
48357:82	most of that's done --n403340 with rifles and such. uh, though there's, you know, probably i'm sure --n403393 some sector that --n4033a6 does it with handguns.	###.###and my, really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how --n402ad8 to hold it right --n402aef###and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb###and blood squirted everywhere.###.###oh, jeez.###.###and so that was really the only experience --n402d0d that i've had --n402d24 with guns###and it, it kind of scared me.###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i think that if i learn how --n402ead to use one --n402ec0, i would, i would feel better.###.###right.###i've also always thought about the idea, you know, most sports, you know, which --n40304e are###the n r a and people have their thing, you know, if you ban guns, you're just banning the, the recreation, the sport of hunting, things of that nature.
48373:24	but i guess it would be some.	###.###right.###i've also always thought about the idea, you know, most sports, you know, which --n40304e are###the n r a and people have their thing, you know, if you ban guns, you're just banning the, the recreation, the sport of hunting, things of that nature.###most of that's done --n403340 with rifles and such. uh, though there's, you know, probably i'm sure --n403393 some sector that --n4033a6 does it with handguns.###but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns, would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous,###you couldn't be inconspicuous, when you walked into a store stuff like that --n403663,###.###yeah.###.###you could see someone coming or dressed --n403749 inappropriately, you know,### you-, if they had --n4037ff to have a rifle or was, you know,### made it more difficult to get a, a, uh, a handgun.###now of course, you know, in this world anytime you've freedom --n403a4e you can be able --n403a65 to get anything you want --n403a84.###.###yeah,###that's true.###.###but i guess to make it more difficult for the person who --n403c46's just so irate and upset and, you know, temporarily a little bit, uh, offset or off keel,###i don't know if that's a large percentage of, uh, crime or not
48532:18	once you get into some of the programs that --n4021ca are out now, you can do so much --n4021f5 with them, that you don't do --n40221c until you really make yourself use them.	###oh, well, well, encourage her to try other things,###because, um, i am, uh,###i work in a school system,###and i teach writing###and we use the computers a great deal for word processing, you know, because students really do seem --n401c9c to be freer when they write on the computer --n401cc7, as you probably found out yourself,###.###yeah.###.###but, um, i also am sponsoring a literary magazine,###and we're doing our entire layout on the computer, uh, because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have --n401f4d, a publishing program.###.###oh, yeah,###.###.### that's, that's neat,###that's, a very good use.###.###so, it is wonderful,###.###.
48582:11	i know some people who --n40304f just,	###.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###they're great for playing games.###.###right.###.###my brother,###.###well, my son is, uh, studying electronic technology,###and he's been able --n402be3 to do things --n402bf6 on, uh, on the personal computer here that --n402c25 really have enhanced his, um, reports, and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way.###.###yeah.###.###um, and i guess it,###if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful,###but, um, unless it is, i guess --n402f76 it's kind of a waste.###.
48629:31	i'm like, i'll get a job some day	###.###and i always,###.###yes,###you can do wonderful design.### it, it's really, s-,###well, especially when anyone who --n403736's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering w-, uh, dr-, drawing --n403785, um,###you have --n4038cb to be so precise.###.###yeah,###and the computer does it all for you.###.###yeah.###.###so it was really neat.###i wanted --n403a2d to go to that course,###but my boss wouldn't pay for it,###.###oh, well.###.
48706:4	some things we can't do --n4055a5,	###.###they take up so much space that you don't have any place --n404d96 then to work --n404db1.###you don't have any, bytes left###.###yeah.###.###but, um, if you, um, if, if you want --n404f62 to go into one that --n404f7d's really useful, you're going --n404fa0 to have --n404faf to go over a thousand dollars,###and even for a personal computer it's probably smart to spend that much,### an-, and we've,###ours is not quite that powerful,###and so, you know, we are, we are limited, which --n405328 may be one reason why,###.### you do run in-, you do run into limitations on yours.###.###.###oh, yeah,###.###oh, wow.###.###uh-huh,
48935:28	and, but still, for some reason, you know, this, this guy's sentence has not been carried --n40443d out, you know,	###.###and that's where a lot of aggravation comes --n4038f4, i think, is, is, uh, these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process,###.###uh-huh.###.###they may spend years,###and, you know, the last i heard --n403b40 it --n403b4b was costing ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars a year, uh, to keep these guys waiting.###.###mumblex.###.###.###yeah,### it, it's amazing.### there's, uh, there's a girl i work with --n403d9a, our secretary, as a matter of fact,### her, her father was murdered --n403ee0, her father and three other guys up here in sherman.###and the, uh, the guy, that they tried and convicted --n403fff and sentenced --n40400e him to death, you know, he's been on death row for like eight years.###.###yeah.###.###and, you know, this, this was her father, uh, you know, that, that --n404217 got killed --n404226, you know, just cold-blooded murder, him and three other people,
49067:11	there are some smaller,	###god, it sounds like, sounds like i'm bragging.###.###no,###that's okay.###.###but it's upper middle class, uh, kind of an environment.###.###okay.###.###it's a two story colonial, which my wife and i designed --n400819.###.###oh, that's neat.###.###uh, it has around thirty-two hundred square feet. uh, five bedrooms and so forth and so on,###.###wow, that's large.###.###and it is, i would imagine in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area.###it might be,###i would say it's probably midsized for the area.
49551:24	and it had some, some nice features.	###yeah.###.###hondas have great resale value.###.###yeah.###.###the mazda definitely did not.###not at all.###they're worse than american cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes.###.###i did pretty well with my, uh, regal because it was in really good shape###but, it still looked real nice,###.###yeah.###.### the, the interior was still really nice,###there wasn't cracks all over the dash board and stuff.###.###right.###.
49875:48	uh, they still have some, some, uh, some draft picks, uh, that they got --n402fa5,	###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###um.###.###but,###.###and i don't, you know,### my, my, my, my main sport is baseball###but, you know, um, i've been enjoying football###but i don't know it as well.###.###yeah.###.###um, i just, you know, um,###cowboys are going --n402d0d to have a problem aren't they.### is it, is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the walker trade --n402e03###or what was the whole deal on that --n402eea.###.
49881:18	actually, they picked up some from minnesota.	###but,###.###and i don't, you know,### my, my, my, my main sport is baseball###but, you know, um, i've been enjoying football###but i don't know it as well.###.###yeah.###.###um, i just, you know, um,###cowboys are going --n402d0d to have a problem aren't they.### is it, is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the walker trade --n402e03###or what was the whole deal on that --n402eea.###.###uh, they still have some, some, uh, some draft picks, uh, that they got --n402fa5,###.###they don't, have anything high do they.###.###.###no.
49908:42	and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys	###.###yeah.###.###what was i thinking --n403371.### they gave up, they, they traded wa-, herschel, to minnesota.###.###they traded walker,###yeah.###.###yeah,###okay.###my brain is really working well tonight.###.###that's okay,###they, um, um,###i've got a friend that, uh, --n403684 lives right next to the cowboys' training camp.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, uh, he gets, he sees them out --n4037a3 running a lot
50235:53	and, and, and i don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it. you know.	###that's absolutely right.###.###i mean the kurds have tried it before.###they've gotten their butts kicked --n401fbe,###.###yeah.###.###and this is just another time that it's happening --n402059.###.### that's, that's absolutely right.###.###you know, they'll regroup out in the mountains###and they'll try it again in a couple of years.###.###yeah,### it was just, you know, it was,###it's a very opportune moment for them to try --n402388.###you know you,###.###sure,
50337:29	and what --n404433's wrong is right in some cases.	###.###and that's a big mistake, because they don't.###.###you bet.###.###.###you bet.###well, yeah,###because there's no, uh, you know, there's, there's, there's a complete different set of values.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, there's, there's different value placed on human life, and, uh, right down the list, you know, possessions and, and everything else.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, what --n4043b7's right is wrong
50370:29	i, i think some of these people that they claim --n404dbd as middle eastern experts don't, don't have a clue sometimes.	###.###you know, it, they, they're, they're so completely different culturally and socially and and religiously,###.###uh-huh.###.### it's just, it was very strange.###.###i believe it.###.###it was very interesting.###.###yeah,###yeah,### i can, i can, i can believe that.###yeah,### i, i don't claim --n404c3d to have an in-depth understanding by any means,###but, uh,###.###now i,###shoot,
50456:132	you know, we, we've got folks running around here who --n40675f get, who --n406776 get degrees in basket weaving and you know, underwater psychology, or some, some ridiculous stuff like that.	###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it, it, it bites us over and over again, the, the, the,###.###yeah,###and until we, until we start --n4061f7 changing our educational system, i mean we're, we're going --n40623e to be, we're,###we've already been overtaken --n4063db,###but it's going --n406444 to get even worse later.###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean looks who --n4064f4's, looks who --n40650b's getting the engineering degrees and the, the math and the science and everything.###.###that's right.###.###it's not us.###.###that's right.###.
50688:54	but there are an awful lot of young people who --n400580 would benefit from, um, some sort of public service, like the conservation corps back in the thirties or, uh, various other things of that sort.	###and, uh, if it does the job, then that's, that's what you need --n40a355.###.###yeah,###now my roomie, on the other hand, he is a power user.###.###.### he's, he's looking now --n40a50d to get rid --n40a520 of his.###he's got a three eighty-six and wants --n40a607 to get a four eighty-six. you know, this kind of stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###what do you think --n400022 about the, uh, peace corps or public service commitment.###.###uh, that's the first i've ever heard --n400100 of it.###i haven't heard of it, anything too much about it.###um,###.###well, i think it was, uh, thought --n4002b0 up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft --n4002e7###and people said, well, they, uh, young people who --n40040f were drafted --n40041e have --n400429 to provide military service to the country,
50706:31	it --n400d60 would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned --n400d9f that --n400daa were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids.	###well, i think it was, uh, thought --n4002b0 up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft --n4002e7###and people said, well, they, uh, young people who --n40040f were drafted --n40041e have --n400429 to provide military service to the country,###but there are an awful lot of young people who --n400580 would benefit from, um, some sort of public service, like the conservation corps back in the thirties or, uh, various other things of that sort.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it seems to me that it's, it's not a totally bad idea,###but i don't quite see how they'd make it work --n400889.###.###uh-huh.###.###how would they decide who --n40094c goes into, uh, building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who --n40098f goes to saudi arabia --n4009a6.###.###right,###yeah.###i,###the,###my first impression was, um, it would be v-, very good.###i think it --n400c12 would be good for people to serve,###but i don't know if it should be an option.
50707:22	and i think there are some available now where they are able --n400f70 to work --n400f7f,	###and people said, well, they, uh, young people who --n40040f were drafted --n40041e have --n400429 to provide military service to the country,###but there are an awful lot of young people who --n400580 would benefit from, um, some sort of public service, like the conservation corps back in the thirties or, uh, various other things of that sort.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it seems to me that it's, it's not a totally bad idea,###but i don't quite see how they'd make it work --n400889.###.###uh-huh.###.###how would they decide who --n40094c goes into, uh, building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who --n40098f goes to saudi arabia --n4009a6.###.###right,###yeah.###i,###the,###my first impression was, um, it would be v-, very good.###i think it --n400c12 would be good for people to serve,###but i don't know if it should be an option.###it --n400d60 would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned --n400d9f that --n400daa were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids.

50720:6	and some people would get civilian, uh, service, like working in hospitals.	###yeah.###i,###the,###my first impression was, um, it would be v-, very good.###i think it --n400c12 would be good for people to serve,###but i don't know if it should be an option.###it --n400d60 would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned --n400d9f that --n400daa were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids.###and i think there are some available now where they are able --n400f70 to work --n400f7f,###but making it a mandatory thing kind of,###.###yeah,### the, the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary.###.###right.###.###and the people who --n4011df were proposing it said that it should be involuntary, that it should be like a draft.###.###uh-huh.###.###and some people would get military service
50777:29	and then you have --n40288f to pay them some kind of a stipend,	###.###it was, uh, something that --n4022f9 was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life.###.###uh-huh.###well, that makes sense.###and then you run into, again, to, um, the bureaucracy in --n402474 running it.###you know, how you going --n402559 to cover that many people --n402574###because we've got a lot more people --n402625 now than we did then###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###sure,###and, in addition to that, we have the cost because you have --n402756 to pay something for, their room and board###.###so,###.###.###right.###.
50847:43	um, well, like i say, i know that there are some type of programs that they have --n403f57 available for a youth, like teenagers to go and do, um, work in the national parks and work in, uh, neighborhoods --n403fd2 to do, um, clean up and that sort of thing.	###you know, i think i did because it, you know, it emphasized that sort of thing.###you know, a lot of self evaluation.###.###sure.###.###.###and it was definitely voluntary, too.###they were not drafting you and sending you, against your will.###.###right.###.###.###right.###and that, i'm sure that would make a big difference, too.###you know, you've got,###.###yeah.###well, what about a voluntary program.###do you think that would be a good idea.###.
51234:47	i mean, the guy's twenty, twenty-five home rums, maybe thirty, eighty some r b i-s.	###i think that's right.###.###okay,###yeah,###so had a lot of fun###actually, i mean, i like minor league baseball, a lot.###it's cheaper for one thing.###.###well, that's true.###i think, i've kind of become a rangers fan over the last eleven years since i've been here.###uh, they've led the american league in batting, fielding and pitching,###but they've never been able --n40122c to do more than one of those in any, any given year.###so.###.###yes.###i think they're in for a odd year this year,###actually, um, they, um,###i don't understand why encovilla got released --n4014a4 --n4014ab.###.###i don't either.
51340:81	you know, i kind of wish that they had inter league play, like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the national league teams here once in a while.	###well it should be an interesting year.###.###yeah,###i'm looking,###i've already been to one game,###and i should have been to two###but,###.###are you an orioles fan.###.###um, the, the team i live and die with --n403173 actually is the red sox,### mostly die,###but, um, i go to the orioles since they're here,###and i, you know, i do enjoy them.###.###yeah.###.###um, i've had an opening day on monday.###.###yeah,
51562:11	they had some other expenses that --n402c7d came up	###.###oh, yes.###and she still loves her to death.###i, mean, when they see each other --n4027ca, you know, they just love each other to death.###.###.###and she literally spent almost the entire amount that i paid her --n4028fd on my daughter. --n402914 either making her clothes or, buying her things.###.###really.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###mumblex.###.###so, we're real, real lucky.###but aft-, uh,###so she stayed with her about, roughly two years,###and she, um, she had --n402bad to go back to work,
51582:32	and, um, it had been recommended --n4031eb by some friends of ours	###they had some other expenses that --n402c7d came up###so she had --n402cfb to go, i guess, --n402d1a get a real job.###.###yeah.### get a real job, full time.###.###yeah.###so, uh,###.###so, what --n402ea0 made you decide --n402eb3 to put her in a montessori school.###.###well, i checked a lot of places --n402f8a out, you know, the kinder cares and the, stuff like that.###.###uh-huh.###yeah.###.###and, uh, i live in garland.###.###.###and, there's this montessori school that --n403153's nearby
51683:28	i mean, he has always got some kind of, cold or something.	###really.###.###and, oh, my god. here we go, you know.###.###that's right.###.###i just hate that,###but, anyway.###so, you don't have any children.###do you have any l-, nieces or nephews then.###.###yeah.###yeah.###i have a nephew.###he's a little brat.###.###.###he goes to a really crummy day school.###my sister's not real bright,### so, but he, he's always sick.
51750:20	and, and some kid goes out and gets the kid	###um, i don't know.###i just feel m-,###.###too many horror stories out there that, you know.###.###yes.###.###.###and that's one reason i like --n405b00 working up there a little bit --n405b1f is, because i know what --n405b3e's really going on.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###that's right.###i think that's an ideal situation.###.###because you don't know, uh,###because like at her school, um, as soon as you drive up it's got like a circular type drive.###they sit###and they have car callers
51876:10	you get some kids in there	###yeah.###.###and it was, it, it was brand new when i checked it out --n407801###and, of course, it was beautiful and, clean and smelled wonderful in there,###.###yeah.###.###but, you know, i, that,###.###.###i didn't base everything on that.###.###.###mumblex.###.###no,###because that all wears off.###.###that's right.###that's exactly right.
52072:4	some, i guess like,	###um, action.###.###bu-, d-,###.### i, i guess one of my favorite, well two of my favorite movies is probably like lethal weapon and lethal weapon two.###.###okay.###.###and those are, those are like two of my most favorite,###i mean they're just really good movies.###and i liked bird on a wire. and movies like that.###.###yeah.###.###.###do you like suspense movies###or do you like, uh, just action###or,###.###um, yeah,
52123:60	now, i, i also liked, uh, oh, gone with the wind or some of the classic, like the lawrence of arabia.	###.### i, i have --n4019a2 to say that probably the one movie that --n4019c9 really threw me back the most, uh, that i was really the most in shock with --n401a18 was probably, uh, star wars.###.###oh, yeah,###well that's,###.###when that first came out --n401c57, i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that.###.###right.###.###i mean, i guess, uh, out of all the movies, i've, i've never been as excited --n401dc0 to go back.###i was ready --n401efa to go back and see it again, you know###.###really.###yeah,###yeah,###you're right about that,###but that that's really like an all time classic.###i mean, i don't think anybody, anything could ever beat that.###.
52283:13	i mean some of them are done --n405416 good	###you know, i don't know,###there's something about people coming up through the sofa --n404c34 to get you, or something, you know, coming out of the t v that --n404c7f just doesn't make my day, you know.###.###yeah,###you're right.###.###.###well it's so,###i guess, i'm a real, i'm a realist,###and so, when i watch movies like that --n404faa, it's like this can not happen.###so, i just don't enjoy it, you know, because it's just like, come on, give me a break.###.###yeah.###.###you know, i mean, i just###and so many of them are done --n405293 so poorly,###.###yeah.###.###you know that, it just doesn't even give you the effect,
52633:62	and having sat on both, uh, uh, criminal --n404d3b and a civil --n404d4e, uh, jury, some of what --n404d75 goes through our courts is a total waste of time.	###uh-huh.###.###i believe crimes against children --n404338 should be punished --n40434b bu-, by, by death. i believe, sexual crimes, unless there's a true change of character.###.###i tend --n404529 to agree on that, very strongly.###.###and that's where we just have --n4045cf to, to trust the authorities --n4045ee.###and they're not going --n4046c4 to excuse people, if it was, was run --n4046f3 like that,###i don't,###there would probably be very few exceptions to that###and if it was done --n4048a2 quickly and done --n4048b5 swiftly### and, but it's not, because the judicial system has rejected, they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have --n4049a1, pretty much.###.###plus the, all the judicial system is overloaded with, all kinds of, um, problems, and crimes and so forth and then all of the, um, civil things that --n404b79 clog the courts,###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
52648:37	i would like --n405294 to see some, some kind of reform, or some kind of streamlining so that, if a person is, um, convicted --n405317, and sentenced --n40532a to, to death, that that automatic appeal which --n405365 goes in could be more quickly dealt with --n40538c.	###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and having sat on both, uh, uh, criminal --n404d3b and a civil --n404d4e, uh, jury, some of what --n404d75 goes through our courts is a total waste of time.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###because we're suit happy.###.###yeah.###.### but, but back to the, to the capital situation, sounds like you and i have a lot of, of, of, uh, common ground at least as, as far as, as capital punishment is concerned --n405059.###.###yeah.###.

53690:14	you've got some kids that --n40062d'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it --n400674,	###bye-bye.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###okay.###.###the public school systems, well everybody's kno-, has known they've needed renovation for years, but never really had a clear direction on which way --n4000a4 to go --n4000b3 with it.###.###uh-huh.###.###the first direction that i can see, or i wish, i would love --n40027a to see them go with --n400299.###kids learn at different rates###and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together.###you'd learn at this rate###and that's the only way it's going --n400514 to happen --n400523.###.###yeah.###that's true.###.
53715:4	some are really going --n401162 to be heavy into reading.	### that's, that's very true.###um, i guess i can relate to that, because i have two kids that --n4009aa are opposites like that.###uh, one picks up real quick###and the other one doesn't.###and you're right,###they do get bored, uh, really fast, if they already know what you're talking about --n400bda.###what do you propose that they do --n400cbe.### what, what is your suggestions --n400d3e.###.###the educators need --n400db8 to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with, uh, the various students --n400e17 to get the maximum potential out of the person.###.###uh-huh.###out of each child.###.###out of each child.###.###each individual child.###.###some kids are going --n40102b to be great with mechanical stuff.###other kids are going --n4010ca to be really into math,

54017:18	just when i get some spare time here and there --n40160f i'll work on it,	###and the things i've tried --n400f72 to do --n400f81 just don't look very good,###.###.###and,###.### i, i guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, i've done, um, some needlepoint.###i've done mostly cross stitching.###i used --n401234 to, uh, do like, um,###one that i did --n4012d9 for both kids are like, oh,###they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals###and then you have their birth date on them,###.###yeah.###.###and then you have a little picture of them###and you frame them and stuff,###.###uh-huh.###.###but nothing steady.
54073:29	and during the week they go back and do some more.	###yeah.###.###but, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it, you know, and, and that the petty point and things like that.###.###yeah.###.### it's like, god, it, it seems like it --n402177's easier just to go out and buy it --n4021a6 already made --n4021b5.###.###mumblex i don't know what, what, is, it's like --n40234c there,###but here a lot of the country stuff --n40243c --n402443 is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling.###.###yeah.###.###and, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff###and there's just tons of stuff everywhere###and, you know, people just do it in their garage###.###yeah.###.###and then on weekends they go out and sell it
54373:11	there are some kurds living in iran.	###well you know what i was hoping --n4067a3.###i was hoping iran was going --n40682d to take a very, um, dramatic stand and invade, you know,###and then like iran's the big bad guy, you know,###but, really, if, if they were going --n406a04 to save people's lives,###.###they've got sixty or so of iraq's planes.###.###yeah,###i know,###it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict --n406be7###but, i, i, you know, i almost swear, i'm kind of disappointed with the iranians,###why they didn't go --n406e0b save,###i mean, i don't know if the kurdish,###i know the shiites are their people.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, i don't know,###i think they have a bond with the, the kurds.###.
54377:31	and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid.	###.###they've got sixty or so of iraq's planes.###.###yeah,###i know,###it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict --n406be7###but, i, i, you know, i almost swear, i'm kind of disappointed with the iranians,###why they didn't go --n406e0b save,###i mean, i don't know if the kurdish,###i know the shiites are their people.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, i don't know,###i think they have a bond with the, the kurds.###.###there are some kurds living in iran.###.###yeah,### i, i think they should have just done more, uh,
54465:147	i keep, you know, um, you know, there's like three movies that i, i keep --n40104e telling myself that i should see --n40106d one of these, you know, some day that i haven't seen --n4010b8, you know, that, that --n4010db are classics, you know.	###.###no,###no.###and, uh, wh-,### let's see, uh,###the most recent ones that i've seen --n400b02 are those two, ghost and, uh, dances with wolves,###but i rent, uh, uh, videos,###do you.###.###yeah,###yeah,###and so we just,###.### you, you watch many.###.###uh, it depends, um, you know, it depends on wh-,###.###do you like the classics like, uh, gone with the wind and, uh, you know the older movies.###.###i'd like --n400f77 to see those,
54511:40	there's, there is, you know some blood and everything	###yeah,###yeah,###it's true.###.###but, um, i think-,###one of the movies we saw --n401d5c recently, we saw, uh, misery.###.###oh, i didn't see that one.###.###that was good, um,###.###really.###.###oh, it was great.###.###.###and it,###you think, you know, for a stephen, you know, it because it was by stephen king it would be really gory###but there's only one,###well there's a couple scenes, at, at the end
54641:42	when you think of what it takes --n404275 to make some of those kind of movies --n4042a0, you know.	###oh, really.###.###yeah,###it's, um,###burton's kind of, uh, e-,###he's, a very odd, odd man###but he's,###i think he's very interesting###and, uh, i liked those two movies of his a lot.###.###uh-huh.###.###he did batman --n404087 also, which, you know.###.###yeah,###that was pretty good, though, really.###.###it was good,###but i mean, he was, um,###.
54840:11	how about some of the ads,	###no,###no,###you're thinking of rick moranis.###he looks like rick moranis###but he's not.###.###oh, okay,###se-,###all right,###yeah,###that's the one i was thinking of --n40793e.###but i have, i've seen quite a few movies,### i, i enjoy them.###i think that, uh, it's, it's kind of like, uh, good entertainment. an, uh, an escape type of thing.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.
54865:37	so, we're probably going --n408532 to like rent those some time and then try --n40855d to see godfather part three somewhere.	###e-,###e-,###a review usually won't make me go --n407f0a see a movie i hadn't already wanted --n407f35 to see --n407f44.###.###yeah.###did you see goodfellas.###.###no,###it's o-, uh,###i want --n4080ff to see it.###.### that wa-, that was pretty good.###um, and,###.###um, we want --n40822c to see godfather part three also###but my, my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago,###.###uh-huh.###.###but i've never seen either of the first, you know, of the, of the godfather movies
55028:10	uh, some of them didn't	###.###i guess you keep those things you grew up with --n400c3b.###i worked in, uh, missouri for a while###and, uh, i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on t v --n400db4 when the cowboys were playing the saint louis cardinals --n400ddf###and i was rooting for the cowboys.###.###yeah.###.###but, they were kind of closer to home when, when i struck up with them --n400fba.###i really don't know what --n4010a3's going --n4010b2 to take place with the cowboys this year.###everybody keeps --n401196 talking about the reconstruction they're going through --n4011c1 and new players and how next year is going --n4011ec to be even bigger and better than the previous year --n40121b.###in a way that happened this past season,###and i think that's quite a bit of optimism --n4013f6 around here that still there's a chance that maybe, uh, these guys are right, maybe they will come through and, and do something this year.###i look for it to be a pretty good year.###.###boy they, uh, they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago.###.###they did,###uh, they got rid --n4017ee of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names --n401825 in that we weren't, weren't familiar with --n401854.###some of them turned out --n40199f to be pretty good players,
55078:22	in a way aikman has done some of that.	###yeah.###.###it's funny, over the years.###.###i guess since staubach left, they haven't been able --n402863 to, keep it going.###.### it's. it's been a rough tow, a rough road to hoe --n402989 ever since he left.###.###.###i don't know why it --n402ac7's so hard to find, uh, a good quarterback these days --n402b06.###.###well, that, that says a lot for the, for his ability, though i think --n402c2c.###for staubach's, i mean.###.###well, yeah.###.###.###you know, he was one of the few who --n402dd8 come through in history that --n402df3 can really perform,###uh, we hope,###every team hopes their current quarterback is going --n402f5a to pull them through.
55120:15	boy, they'd some big changes, speaking of them.	###so, i don't know###i'm looking for a good year.###i guess we're always looking for a good year.###.###so, obviously though, do you think they're going --n403dff to do anything in the playoffs --n403e1e to make it to the super bowl this year###or who do you, who do you like --n403f66 to do that this year.###.###uh, no###i don't think the cowboys have got a chance.###i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year,###and they'll get close to it.###they'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end.###.###so who's --n404314 going --n40431f to beat them.###who are they going --n4043a6 to blow it to --n4043bd.###.###uh, that's a good question.###uh, i'm figuring either one either the eagles or possibly san francisco###i'm not real sure.###.
55159:38	uh, marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes, because of some of the stupid stuff he does --n4050e7,	###.###yeah.### that, that sure was a fun super bowl to watch --n404cda this year.###.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###.###i mean, i wasn't pulling for either team.###.###no,###no.###.###but that was just a good football game.###.###and it's funny, you know.###you like --n404f8b to pull for the underdog###and for a long time i was pulling for denver.###.###uh-huh.###.
55219:110	and my reasons are based --n400210 upon not only from what i read --n40023f in the newspapers, what i see --n400262 on the newspapers, but up against some of the, fun and exciting things i ran into --n4002b5 during my six years as a soldier in the fifth special forces group.	###yeah,### enjoyed it bob.###.###you guys have a good time,### keep those printers coming.###.###hey,###we'll do it.###.###all right,###bye.###.###bye.###.###.### go ahead.###.###okay,###do i still can-, still can feel that the soviet union, as such, is still a threat to the civilized western world.###absolutely.
55284:85	there's probably five or six, which --n4029ce would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that --n402a05 are in positions over some of these soviet states.	###.###i'm surprised during this iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did.###these guys are top of the line.### when they, when they graduate from there --n401dc6, they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world.###and they are very, very good at what they do --n401f07.###so until i see the entire, quote, old guard of the soviet military, of the soviet government completely roll over and disappear, --n401fe9 preferably buried --n401ff8, i still consider them a threat.###.###uh-huh.###.###their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist gen-, generals that --n4021c0 actually control tens and thousands of troops. that irregardless of what soviet policy is --n402207, --n402212 they're going --n402225 to do what the general tells them --n402248 --n40224f.###.###yeah.###i guess that's what --n402484 concerns me the most. is they're, they're so unstable that somebody like that could make, uh, decisions that --n4024ef would jeopardize a lot of people.###.###well, it --n4026d1's in-, interesting watching the different soviet states, albania, lithuania, doing their little revolts down there.###.###uh-huh.###.###each one of those sectors has got a soviet general over the troops that --n40286f are there.###so far they haven't run into the real psychos yet.
55311:27	but on a highly populated area, like some of the soviet cities would be, with the weaponry that --n403462's attached --n403471 on those things, there is no place to hide --n4034a8.	###they get real nasty, the hyundee helicopters come out###and they, would level entire areas.###okay,###you're from the dallas area, right.###.###uh-huh.###.###okay,###you know, basically the size of, uh, the area around richardson.###.###yeah.###.###you put five soviet hyundee helicopters in the air, they can level the entire area###and there won't be anything left alive.###and they can do that in about four minutes.###.###huh.###.###and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.###they used them in afghanistan, did re-, remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in --n40331f.
55329:33	but, during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, i mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff.	###and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.###they used them in afghanistan, did re-, remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in --n40331f.###but on a highly populated area, like some of the soviet cities would be, with the weaponry that --n403462's attached --n403471 on those things, there is no place to hide --n4034a8.###if the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, then, then the nerve gas definitely will get you.###the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time.###they drink that much fuel.###.###uh-huh.###.###were you,###have you,###i take it you haven't spent any time in the military.###.###no,###i haven't.###.###as a civilian that --n403a3f's never been attached --n403a56 to any form of the military, i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in --n403aad, never did make the newspapers.###.###uh-huh.###.
55386:25	and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself.	###.###inflation is out of this world###and the governments, which our government has technically supported --n404b80 for years, are corrupt as all get out.###and generally the people, are getting screwed --n404c80,###.###.###and they're tired of it,###and they're willing --n404d44 to try anything --n404d57 to get out from under it, even if that means going to communism.###.###yeah.###well, i think russia is getting to the point where they're, they're about --n404eed to do something --n404f00 to get out of communism --n404f1b.###i guess i'd would like --n40508f to see somebody like yeltsin to get more power.###i think gorbachev has about had his day.###.###unfortunately, yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard.###that's the only drawback that i see --n4052bd with the entire thing.###.###yeah.###.###gorbachev has made his attempt
55892:50	uh, and i find ways --n401cfa to, to turn some of that back to, to others --n401d3d.	###.###uh-huh.###.###and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever.###but i, i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the country in other ways. be it cleaning out, uh, lots, in, in their neighborhood or, whatever kind of community or public service --n40148d might be available.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i guess i see that as, as not so much a demand but, but a privilege.### it's, it's kind of, uh, uh, it's something,###.###it is, uh,###.### it's, it's###since we live here and we all --n401a30 benefit, rich, poor or in between, uh, there are benefits even for those who --n401a7f have it the hardest.###i just see that as maybe a good idea.###i wouldn't mind --n401c49 doing it at forty-four.###.###uh-huh.###.
55919:10	it gave some folks some jobs,	###.###i could see a, a full, a run-, a gamut of different kinds of opportunities.###things that --n402776 need --n402781 to be done --n402794, that --n4027a3 wou-, that --n4027b6 could be done --n4027c9 in an hour or two, uh, a day, or several hours of the week. like a half of a day on saturday or something like that. in addition to what one does --n402864, uh, besides that.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.### i, i can't, imagine what kind of, uh, uh, bureaucracies --n402b6c we'd get into --n402b83 and expense --n402b92 having it be full time,###oh, you're going --n402cf7 to go to this camp###and you're going --n402d8b to, you know,###like, um, back in the depression, the c c c, the construction corps that --n402e58 went out and did things. that was great,###.###yeah.###.###it was needed --n402f8e,
55919:15	it gave some folks some jobs,	###.###i could see a, a full, a run-, a gamut of different kinds of opportunities.###things that --n402776 need --n402781 to be done --n402794, that --n4027a3 wou-, that --n4027b6 could be done --n4027c9 in an hour or two, uh, a day, or several hours of the week. like a half of a day on saturday or something like that. in addition to what one does --n402864, uh, besides that.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.### i, i can't, imagine what kind of, uh, uh, bureaucracies --n402b6c we'd get into --n402b83 and expense --n402b92 having it be full time,###oh, you're going --n402cf7 to go to this camp###and you're going --n402d8b to, you know,###like, um, back in the depression, the c c c, the construction corps that --n402e58 went out and did things. that was great,###.###yeah.###.###it was needed --n402f8e,
55920:12	and we got some great public works out of it.	###i could see a, a full, a run-, a gamut of different kinds of opportunities.###things that --n402776 need --n402781 to be done --n402794, that --n4027a3 wou-, that --n4027b6 could be done --n4027c9 in an hour or two, uh, a day, or several hours of the week. like a half of a day on saturday or something like that. in addition to what one does --n402864, uh, besides that.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.### i, i can't, imagine what kind of, uh, uh, bureaucracies --n402b6c we'd get into --n402b83 and expense --n402b92 having it be full time,###oh, you're going --n402cf7 to go to this camp###and you're going --n402d8b to, you know,###like, um, back in the depression, the c c c, the construction corps that --n402e58 went out and did things. that was great,###.###yeah.###.###it was needed --n402f8e,###it gave some folks some jobs,
55933:33	and this would give them a chance --n4036a7 to have some positive self-esteem.	###and you're going --n402d8b to, you know,###like, um, back in the depression, the c c c, the construction corps that --n402e58 went out and did things. that was great,###.###yeah.###.###it was needed --n402f8e,###it gave some folks some jobs,###and we got some great public works out of it.###but, um, i don't see that as --n4030c6 being necessary now.###i can see it being done --n403170, uh, on a regular schedule.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, everybody has --n40323c to put in so many hours of, uh, public service in a given time, perhaps.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i, i guess i see all of us benefiting,###and i, i don't see it just relegated --n40346e to the young.###but i see, i, i see so much --n403555 going on that, that --n403570's bad.
55947:53	you take pride in that, and, and get some, some positive feedback from those --n403a32 who --n403a3d benefit, besides yourself.	###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i, i guess i see all of us benefiting,###and i, i don't see it just relegated --n40346e to the young.###but i see, i, i see so much --n403555 going on that, that --n403570's bad.###and this would give them a chance --n4036a7 to have some positive self-esteem.###.###uh-huh.###.###something that they turn --n403762, back.###.###well,###.###.###and also, you know, you, you feel more like, you know, you're actually part of the community if you've done something, in it.###.###that's right.###.###.
56003:40	and i can see, you know, some, some really significant things coming out of it.	###uh-huh.###.###and i guess, i don't see, uh, this being that different. but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in --n404ab8, and would take a turn in --n404adb.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###yeah.###.###do you have kids.###.### n-, no,###not yet.###in about six months we will.###.###oh, well good.### th-, you'll have a little time think about that --n404e1e.###i guess, i, i have, uh,###when i was teaching school --n404f9f i saw many, so many kids that --n404fc6 were at loose ends and that --n404fe5 didn't really have a purpose.
56053:54	and i thought i had seen, when we were traveling around the state --n40671d, some similar signs --n406734 up that --n406743 indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up --n406772	###.###.###and, uh, there was a,###.###.###and there were those that --n405fa0 said, no, you can't do that, i'm sure --n405fdf.###.###yeah.###well, uh, it was, it was interesting because that's an interesting question, you know.###.###yeah.###.###should these people be allowed --n406220 to or not.###i think they finally decided --n4062bc not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going --n4062f7 to get trashed --n40630a.###.###oh.###and i hadn't even thought about that, uh, the, the other end of that.### that, that's an interesting, uh, situation.###i hadn't thought of that.###we had visited relatives in virginia, not too long ago,
56072:31	and they, they've started some recycling campaigns that --n407056 a year before that had been turned down --n40707d because they said, well, it's not feasible,	###we had visited relatives in virginia, not too long ago,###and i thought i had seen, when we were traveling around the state --n40671d, some similar signs --n406734 up that --n406743 indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up --n406772###and,###.###yeah.###i think virginia's got it###and i know maryland does,###and we just, we went to indianapolis last weekend, and back.###and, um, i'm pretty sure i saw, yeah, stuff --n406acc in ohio and indi-, indiana --n406af3 about it and pennsylvania, maybe pennsylvania,###i don't remember for sure now.###.###and i don't know about your part of the country,###but, uh, down here in the last, oh, year plus, i, it was las-, beginning with last year's earth day there's just been more of a turn toward uh, environmental concerns,###.###uh-huh.###.###and e-, i work for texas instruments.###.###uh-huh.###.
56101:53	but, it --n408407 is comforting to me to see, uh, more concern about some of these things that, that --n40845e cost us money.	###.###.###it's just, thing, a part of everyone's consciousness.###.###uh-huh.###well, the thing about that is though, it's got a,###i mean because it was, i mean it was big, you remember, like in the early seventies and all that.### and, you know, and then it kind of just went out of vogue.###and i, i'm worried that it, it might, you know, it'll, it, the same thing will happen.###it's like, you know, environmentalism was really big for a couple of years###and then people like, well, you know,###i'd ruther, rather spend, you know, fifty cents less on, uh, on, on such and such, you know,###and even if it's not environmentally safe, who --n407f3a cares, you know.###.###i'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way.###uh, there have been too many other things that it's done that for --n4080b7, just in my life.###and if you look at history at all, you see that, you know, uh, we go from one side to the other on just about any subject, that you, one might care --n40822e to bring --n40823d up.###.###yeah.###.
56109:69	it --n408a31's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may, may, make some people realize that hey, you know, this stuff runs out.	###and i, i'm worried that it, it might, you know, it'll, it, the same thing will happen.###it's like, you know, environmentalism was really big for a couple of years###and then people like, well, you know,###i'd ruther, rather spend, you know, fifty cents less on, uh, on, on such and such, you know,###and even if it's not environmentally safe, who --n407f3a cares, you know.###.###i'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way.###uh, there have been too many other things that it's done that for --n4080b7, just in my life.###and if you look at history at all, you see that, you know, uh, we go from one side to the other on just about any subject, that you, one might care --n40822e to bring --n40823d up.###.###yeah.###.###but, it --n408407 is comforting to me to see, uh, more concern about some of these things that, that --n40845e cost us money.###especially when we have dwindling, uh, resources such as oil that --n4085db's burning out of control in the persian gulf, and, and so forth --n40861e.### just, just every little bit does,###it makes me feel --n4087d6 better.### it, it makes me feel like, well, there may be something left for my children, my nieces and nephews and so forth.###.###well, yeah, uh.###well, uh, wouldn't,
56132:85	uh, or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say, oh, my goodness, now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology.	###.###of course, that's probably blasphemy for you to say --n408cbc, uh, --n408ccf coming from where you are --n408cea in texas.###.###uh, no,###no,###because if, we,###what was it --n408e9e, seventy-four when we had the, the last last oil crisis --n408ee1.###and, uh, we started --n408fdc getting smart### and, and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth.###.###uh-huh.###.###and as soon as the oil prices came back down, we, the pendulum swang the other way.###.###right.###.###and we need those reminders.###.###yeah.###.
56198:25	and you put a bay leaf and put some, uh, red pepper over it.	###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook --n4004d5, garlic bread, green salad, tea,###and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert.###.###oh, it sounds fantastic.###.###yes.###and what --n40068e --n400695's really neat about it is, the shrimp is cooked --n4006c8 in your, uh, like your rice steamer, your rice cooker.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, you place the shrimp in the, in the rice steamer,
56203:18	or you can just get some, you know, regular red peppers.	###.###and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook --n4004d5, garlic bread, green salad, tea,###and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert.###.###oh, it sounds fantastic.###.###yes.###and what --n40068e --n400695's really neat about it is, the shrimp is cooked --n4006c8 in your, uh, like your rice steamer, your rice cooker.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, you place the shrimp in the, in the rice steamer,###and you put a bay leaf and put some, uh, red pepper over it.###.###uh-huh.###.###now, you can either use, you know, the kind that --n400a61 comes in the little can
56317:78	and while that's cooking, i take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,	###and you rotate it one time.###.###and it's, are you cooking the whole head at one time.###.###uh-huh.###.###.### y-, uh, when you core it --n401fe0, you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off.###.###okay.###.###.###i see.###.###and, uh, you just set it in there,###and you microwave it on high for seven minutes,###and you turn it one time.###.###uh-huh.###.
56319:15	and i shred up some just regular white cheese.	###and it's, are you cooking the whole head at one time.###.###uh-huh.###.###.### y-, uh, when you core it --n401fe0, you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off.###.###okay.###.###.###i see.###.###and, uh, you just set it in there,###and you microwave it on high for seven minutes,###and you turn it one time.###.###uh-huh.###.###and while that's cooking, i take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,###and i mix it all together.
56375:42	and, uh, usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up, and put some color into it, you know,	###and it makes it a real nice looking, you know.###.###and it's not much work.###.###.###huh-uh,###huh-uh.###but it looks like it, you know.###.###that sounds,###.###.###yeah,###real-,###.###you look like you went to a whole bunch,###.###i bet it tastes good too.###.###right.
56417:25	oh. you ought --n404069 to try some crawfish.	###and it depends, out here, like the type of people you're going --n4038ab to entertain --n4038ba, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's hard, uh,### you, you just have --n403a4a to pick something, for the, the group that you're going --n403a85 to entertain for --n403a98 that particular time.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, they're big on finger food --n403c2f here, too. you know, chicken wings and, uh, ribs, and that kind of stuff. uh, barbecue and, uh, cooking out in the yard, it, ya-, you know, when it's nice --n403cee. barbecue outside, chicken and that kind of stuff.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###have you ever had crawfish.###.###uh, no,###but i have had shrimp.###.
56656:83	um, you don't even have --n407d4d to go all the way to new orleans, you know, if you want --n407d90 to really get some good food.	###uh-huh.###.###i have a passion for all that type of different tastes.###because i have been brought --n407778 up mostly italian american food.###because my, uh, parents are italian and portuguese.###so we cook a lot of pasta, and, uh, gravies, and pizzas, and, you know, roasts, and that kind of thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's why i enjoy --n4079ec going to restaurants and have, you know, trying different things --n407a23.###.###well, have you ever thought about --n407b31 coming to louisiana, you know, --n407b54 to visit.###.###i would love --n407c24 to.###.###yeah.###you ought, --n407ca8 to come down.###.###i,###.
56683:20	and, uh, i have some friends that --n408621 live down there.	###.###but, uh, of course, the further south you go --n407fd9, the better the food is --n407ff8, as far as i'm concerned --n40801b.###.###is that right.###.###and fact is, we're going --n40816a to take a vacation this year.###we're going --n408223 to go to new orleans, again.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, we're only going down there for the food, though.###.###now, wher-, where do you go when you go there --n4083b8 --n4083bf.###uh, right on basin street and those places.###.###uh, yeah.###we go to the, the french quarters and stuff like that.###.###uh-huh.###.
56809:31	and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them	###and, uh, wish i could vote on more things frankly.###.###that's right, um,###.###but it's funny because here in california things are getting, uh, increasingly democratically oriented, in, in the sense of people being able --n40150f to vote for things.###i mean, we have these initiatives, state initiatives now.###.###oh.###.###the first really popular, you know wide spread one was, uh, proposition thirteen which --n401771 was a, uh, tax revolt, against property taxes.###.###right,###i r-,###.###uh, and, you know, now we're,###and that was whatever, ten years ago###and now we're up to proposition a hundred and fifty or something like that.###i mean, we've just,###there were apparently voters who --n401b24 just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked, being asked --n401b6f --n401b76 to make decisions on topics that --n401b95 would have three different competing proposals###and you had --n401d55 to vote for, you know, yes or no on each of them
56842:9	uh, some countries voting is obligatory.	###.###i do t-,###.###i think our elected officials say they are speaking for us###but they're not speaking for me.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###yeah,###i wouldn't mind --n40264a having, oh, more votes than i get --n402675 to have, frankly.###.###that's true.###.###anyone who --n402793 doesn't vote, it's fine with me as long as i can have their vote.###.###.###that would make me happy though.###maybe not in a, in a deep philosophical sense, but in a selfish sense, it probably would.###i don't know,###it's interesting,
56897:6	and some people don't vote,	###i mean, we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country,###we have the duty to pay taxes.###.###it's a duty, right.###.###and in that country it --n40358b's a duty to pay taxes###and it --n403631's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent --n403668 --n40366f.###and it --n403730's not clear to me that, that's so much less democratic.###um. i don't know,###.###uh-huh.###.###but part of me rebels against that,###.### i, it's, that's, it's complex question when you start --n403939 thinking about it --n40394c, isn't it.###.###but then i'm an american.###.###.###yeah.
56902:19	but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote.	###and in that country it --n40358b's a duty to pay taxes###and it --n403631's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent --n403668 --n40366f.###and it --n403730's not clear to me that, that's so much less democratic.###um. i don't know,###.###uh-huh.###.###but part of me rebels against that,###.### i, it's, that's, it's complex question when you start --n403939 thinking about it --n40394c, isn't it.###.###but then i'm an american.###.###.###yeah.###and some people don't vote,###i mean there is###like three or four percent of australians don't vote###and i think they're el-, eligible for a fine.###i don't know if they actually are fined --n403d30 or, or what --n403d47 happens,
57069:61	and, uh, he makes a very, uh, passionate, good argument for why you don't want some things decided --n4088d7 by democratic process --n4088ea,	###no,###i haven't.###.###um, oh, hamilt-, i think it was hamilton who --n407deb wrote number ten or something, where he was arguing for a republican --n407e26, not in the sense of the republican party now, versus a democratic --n407e65, uh, government and, arguing successfully, why, the united states should be a republic, not a democracy. which indeed it really is --n407edc --n407ee3 --n407eea,###a republic, not a democracy.###.###right.###.###where he defines dep-, democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who --n40822d vote for someone who --n408244 then in turn votes for the issues --n408267.###in other words, you vote for representatives.###.###uh-huh.###.###and the whole idea was, um, presumably those who --n4084a2 get voted --n4084b1 in would be wiser than the average person, and, and, a specialist and able --n4084fc to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy,###.###.###because just as you can have a tyranny of a single, um, you know, bad ruler or something, you can have a tyranny of the majority.###.###uh-huh.###.
57073:15	if there's some minority that people don't like --n408cb0 because of, you know, racial hatred or something like that, the majority can just simply vote again-, vote against them.	###a republic, not a democracy.###.###right.###.###where he defines dep-, democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who --n40822d vote for someone who --n408244 then in turn votes for the issues --n408267.###in other words, you vote for representatives.###.###uh-huh.###.###and the whole idea was, um, presumably those who --n4084a2 get voted --n4084b1 in would be wiser than the average person, and, and, a specialist and able --n4084fc to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy,###.###.###because just as you can have a tyranny of a single, um, you know, bad ruler or something, you can have a tyranny of the majority.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, he makes a very, uh, passionate, good argument for why you don't want some things decided --n4088d7 by democratic process --n4088ea,###because anytime you have a majority --n4089f5, um, they can change the law in a democ-, a fully democratic process###and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case --n408b61.###um, oh, you know, a candi-,
57188:71	i believe at i b m they, they make you wear a blue suit and, uh, some kind of colored shirt and a tie.	###.###yeah.###.###i mean, uh, my brother works for t i###and he's a computer programmer, or computer engineer.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, you know, whenever he was going to school --n40249c, he was expecting --n4024b3 to --n4024be having --n4024c9 to wear, uh, a tie or a dress shirt everyday.###but, uh, he goes to work in his blue jeans, t-shirt, and tennis shoes,###.###uh-huh.###.###and he just loves it.###.###and that's very acceptable at t i.###.###yeah.###.
57207:40	and he'll be over there until july first --n40305a setting up some kind of computers for them.	###.###i believe at i b m they, they make you wear a blue suit and, uh, some kind of colored shirt and a tie.###.###that's what i've heard --n40299b.###.###uh-huh,### i wo-, i would hate --n402a32 to be in that atmosphere.###.###but, uh, i mean, they, they just moved into the new building,###he calls it the new building.###i don't know,###it's where all the executives are --n402c8b.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, um, and so they were, they were going --n402d4f to try --n402d5e to take their blue jean code with them and trying --n402d8d to get all the, all the upper level to start --n402dc0 wearing blue jeans.###but, he just left for italy today at four,###.###oh.###.
57403:47	it had, uh, leather, leather designs and, um, some other, other little things on it	###.###right.###.###so that, that has a lot to do with it.###.###right.###.###but, um,###well,###.###like i bought, i bought the most beautiful swe-, uh, sweater from, uh, i believe it was --n407800 ross dress for less.###.###uh.###.###and it wa-, it was really pretty,### it was just, you know, it was just plain, a plain, uh, ro-, you know, round, uh, necked, uh, sw-, sweater.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it had, like, it was embellished around the, the top, you know,
57461:13	and that was some time ago,	###uh-huh.###.###but places like ross dress for less and, uh, t j max.###.###t j max does that,###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah###we have a t j max over here###and, um,###.###.###i don't know what the,###the last thing i've done --n4000a8 as far as car repairs go is, is change oil and filter an, and that kind of stuff.###i haven't gotten really involved in anything, uh, extensive in car repairs in, oh, oh, probably a year or so.###i think the last thing i did --n4003b9 of any significance was change the water pump on an oldsmobile.###.###yeah,###i had a similar thing, that i've worked on cars ever since i was, uh, a kid.
57643:110	i'm convinced that, uh, detroit or whoever it is --n40495a made a major mistake, years ago when they stopped --n404989 putting the small v eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes --n4049d0.	###but it turns out a pickup wasn't what i really needed --n4042ae,###.###yeah.###.###and it was the van that i needed --n404380 then, --n40438f to buy the, you know,### traded it in on the chevy van.###but, uh, sure enjoyed it.###.###but yo-, you got the, the three fifty in the van.###.###yeah,###yeah###the three fifty regular gas engine.###.###yeah,###that's what i like --n4046c3 because, they've got plenty of power,###and, uh, if you treat them right, they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be --n4047fd.###.###uh-huh.###.
57651:63	i'm convinced that the small v eight like the, the mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the chevy two eighty-threes, were good little v eight engines that --n404c14 were not gas guzzlers	###but yo-, you got the, the three fifty in the van.###.###yeah,###yeah###the three fifty regular gas engine.###.###yeah,###that's what i like --n4046c3 because, they've got plenty of power,###and, uh, if you treat them right, they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be --n4047fd.###.###uh-huh.###.###i'm convinced that, uh, detroit or whoever it is --n40495a made a major mistake, years ago when they stopped --n404989 putting the small v eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes --n4049d0.###.###yeah###co-,###.###.###uh-huh.###.
57861:27	um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that i know --n40047a now, i, i'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.	###yeah.###speakeranan*t131-2.###.###yeah,###well.###.###anyway let you go.###thanks for talking.###.###okay,###all right.###bye-bye.###.###.###uh, i have, uh, i guess --n40003a a lot of thoughts about the vietnam war, um,### i, i guess i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on###and so there's probably a lot of things i remember --n400267 and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what --n4002ae was happening --n4002bd.###.###yeah.###.
57998:87	i-, if they could just cut out all the fat and, and get it lean, and start --n404841 addressing some of the other issues, i think --n404870 we could take care of everything. and quit --n40489b taking care of all these other countries all across the world, you know, who --n4048e2 just end up --n4048f5 using things against us later on anyway.	###i mean, th-, my, my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries###and we have so many problems --n4040df here at home that we don't address --n404106.###.###that we don't get --n4041c4 fixed --n4041cf.###.###that's right.###.###i know.###.### and, and tha-, that's what --n4042ca frustrates me more than anything.###.###and i, i believe that we have --n4043d2 to have a military###and i believe that we have --n40449d to have a defense --n4044b4 to keep anybody else from --n4044cf walking in and doing it to us.###.###right.###.###but i also believe that we need --n40462e to turn so much of that inward.###.###i think there's a lot of waste### and, and they don't,
58110:21	and som-, for some reason those people don't see that.	###right,###we-,###the,###when this war broke out --n4069d3 it frustrated me all thi-, the antiwar people and, you know, their, all the demonstrations that --n406a36 were going on.###.###yeah.###.###i felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity###because those kind of people, i mean, you know, they're the kind of people who --n406c9c are, who --n406caf've always got --n406cc2 to have a cause, whether it's good, bad of indifferent.###they've got --n406ecf to have a cause### and, and, i, you know, nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're, you're supporting the war.###.###that's right.###that's right.###.###.### yo-, you have --n407183 to support the people that --n40719e are there.###.###that's right.###.
58285:68	and america does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting, you know, some other model.	###that's right.###.###uh, i don't know,###i mean even britain has converted over###and we inherited this mess from them###and, uh,###.###that's right,###it's all their fault.###.###well, i mean, it's more --n401cf1 our fault than theirs at this point because they, they saw the light, um,###i don't know why they we-, um, were more able than we were --n401e7f###except i think, that they probably just said well, we're just going --n401f91 to start --n401fa0 using the things now###and you sort of have --n4020ac to force people to change since they don't want --n4020db to.###.###of course, being part of the european community, if everybody else did it they, they were probably much more,### is much more necessary for them than for us.###.###that's true,### that's, that's probably true
58411:15	um, i do some every now and then,	###.###that's true.###well, sure have enjoyed our talk.###.###yes,###well get back to what you're doing --n40520a###and i'll do the same.###i enjoyed --n4052e0 talking with you too.###.###okay,###god bless y-,###bye-bye.###.###okay.###bye-bye.###.###.###okay,###so do you do a lot of cooking in your family.###.
58800:5	some of the stuff is good,	###speakerb97-1*t97-1.###but.###speakeranan*t97-1.###speakera97-2*t97-2.###yeah,###speakerbnan*t97-2.###speakera98-1*t98-1.###it --n404d13's hard to get a protein content up then.###speakerbnan*t98-1.###speakerb98-2*t98-2.###yeah,###yeah.###speakeranan*t98-2.###.###that's true.###yeah,### i like, i like them every now and then for a change,###.### ye-, it's nice.###yeah,
58962:27	ye-, you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else	###speakerb131-1*t131-1.###oh yeah.###speakeranan*t131-1.###speakera131-2*t131-2.###but, uh, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad --n407024###and then you add all these other ingredients to it,###speakerbnan*t131-2.###speakera132-1*t132-1.###but.###speakerbnan*t132-1.###speakerb132-2*t132-2.###yeah,###and then you sa-, you make the bread###speakeranan*t132-2.###speakerb133-1*t133-1.###but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.###speakeranan*t133-1.###speakera133-2*t133-2.###yeah###right,
59544:10	and then some of the bigger companies,	###.###but, uh,###.###i think it would be neat if, if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you --n408f1f.###.###well you know more and more of them are,###i don't know if it is up there where you are --n40917f###but where i am --n40922c, the, just like all the hospitals, they're getting day care.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###are they.###.###but the reason they had --n409392 to do this --n4093a5 was because so many people, you know, so many women could not afford,###like you said if you had four kids, or even if you had two kids, you would be paying all your salary --n40956a to pay for those two kids to go.###.###right.###.###so, uh, more and more of our hospitals, especially, over here are getting them
59652:37	and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems.	###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###what i don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it's it wouldn't,###you don't want --n4024c5 to have someone making a personal trust in that way, i would hope --n402508.###i mean, because i mean someone###the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get --n402677 to have a gun###and someone the personal sheriff,###.###well,###.###mumblex,###.### the only, well, the criteria the sheriff would have --n4027cc to follow --n4027e3### has, is this guy a convicted felon.###uh, is he a habitual trouble maker.###are we picking him up every saturday, for a drunk and disorderly###.###yeah.###.
59895:11	he had some cocaine and th-, it was accused --n40114d of selling it,	###uh-huh.###.###but on that one thing, i, i still think it should be a unanimous decision,###.###oh, yeah,###i agree.###yeah.###.###uh, i think we're getting to the point --n400bcd now where they're going --n400be8 to eventually let it be, um, majority vote --n400c17.###and that's not going --n400d50 to be good.###.###i don't like that,###no,###.###no.###.###i don't like that at all.###i know my husband served on a, on a jury a few months ago up here in denton,###but, uh, it was a guy, it was, it was a drug conviction###and i don't remember
59953:42	i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change, you know.	###so here they based their sentencing --n4024e1 thinking that this was this guy's first offense,###.###sure.###.### and so, you know, we'll give him fifteen which --n4025e7 will teach him a lesson###but it's not just, you know, horrible, since it was first offense###.###yeah.###.###and he'd been convicted --n4027ea three times before, you know,###.###oh.###.### and, and the jury was very upset###and my husband came home, a home, very upset,###i mean, he felt like that, that they had been tricked --n402a0b, you know,###.###right.###.### and so something,
60034:130	and then we'll have all, we'll have, we will have the money if we would do that to, to work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here	###i know people say, oh, it --n403e5e would be cruel to, you know, pull our aid from these other countries### and, and maybe so,###so tell them, you've got five years. to work out a plan, to make it on your own --n40406b --n404072.###.###right.###.###.###yeah.###.###and, we will continue --n4041e2 funding you for the next two years,###after two years we'll cut it down seven to seventy fiv-, you know, seventy-five percent.###.###uh-huh.###.###and after another year we'll cut it fifty percent,###and in five years, it sh-,###by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help --n404503.###.###sure.###.
60333:19	my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think he's outgrown --n405671 now,	###.###oh.###.###and one of the fish was missing###and they couldn't find it anyplace,###they couldn't figure out what --n40522b had happened###and then they found it fried on,, the radiator behind.###.###oh.###.###mumblex it was not gross,###i didn't see it###but, um, mumblex got them.###.###oh.###.### trying --n405478 to remember###we had a dog for a while,###and i don't know if we got rid --n405549 of the dog###because my brother was allergic to it,
60370:36	i could see some --n406306 having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that --n406335 are really, really pretty	###but i've just never s-, seen the attraction of having fish.###it's not as much fun.###.###well, a friend of mine had, um, an eel,###.###an eel.###.###and then he had a, um,###i forget what type of fish it was --n405ecd,###it was one of these fish that i-, it would eat, --n405f80 it ate a big other fish and things like that.###there would be sort of moby fish in a tank.###.###oh, now we really get sick.###.###yeah,###and it,### i, i couldn't see --n40622e having fish like that.###.###yeah.###.
60662:8	but some of the internal news and the news services,	###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah,### it, it,###.### wh-, what kind of time frame is it, uh, looking --n400c01 for the, uh, different shifts up there.###.###i,###who --n400d27 knows.###.###is it, uh,###basically, i had read that they're just looking at --n400dd1 relocating them all to mckinney is it --n400df4, texas,###.###no,###all means about fifteen to twenty percent, of, of, oh,###.###oh, wow.###.###i'm sure the number's s-, somewhere classified
60699:26	and, and that has some opportunities	###well, that's, uh, that's unfortunate###is there many other,###are you in the defense.###.###oh, yes, mumblex.###.###is it, uh, many other corporations in the area.###.###uh, i saw seven eleven that --n40167d was hiring.###.###well, i'm sure with the new, uh, aw-, contract awarding### i, i think it went to lockheed, didn't it.###.###yes.###.### that, uh, i hear they're hiring all over the place for that.###.###yeah, uh,###no,###apple's coming to town
60926:36	and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid --n4061ec off between now and then.	###momentum is, uh, driving force in our lives.###.###uh-huh.###.### but, so, yeah,###i'm looking as, as a opportunity.###.###well, that's good,###you've got a good attitude about it.###.### and, and i'm looking at it as a change.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i'm looking at it as, as an adventure.###.###right,###there you go --n4060ba.###that's the way to do it --n40611c.###.
60960:37	on channel thirteen, uh, they had some, some programs the day before,	###.###bye.###.###good-bye.###.###.###so, well, this is an appropriate topic the day after earth day,###so.###.###right.###.###um, well, what do you think --n400113 is, uh, the pollutants, the main pollutants in the air.###.###i have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that### i just, uh, i think they put off so much###and they're not regulated --n4003a3 enough.###.###yeah,###well, that's me too.###after, um,
60990:30	but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the, um, what they do --n401729, uh, --n40173c to, uh, make their dough and st-, to, clean out the flour and stuff like that,	###.###and that actually, um, as our population increases and, you know, our, of course, our, our cars, you know, our number of cars --n4009af increase per the population, that's the problem.###but also like you said the industry pollution###and, you know, their reg-, their regulation that --n400c41's placed --n400c50 on them is, i mean, it's better than it used --n400c8b to be###but it --n400e20's incredible that they still don't have, you know, they don't, they're not made --n400e83 to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put --n400eae into the air.###.###right.###.###you know, i, i just,###i can't stand that###and i know for a fact that they get away with a lot that,###you know, they're supposed --n401248 to be regulated --n40125b because we have a, we have a plant, i don't know about t i but we have a plant, uh, a pillsbury plant, in, in a town adjacent to ours,###.###uh-huh.###.###and i know people that --n401571 work there that,###of course, you wouldn't think pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,###.###no.###.
61000:7	and some of the people that --n401b69 work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming --n401b9c they, you know, shut down everything and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're, that they're dumping things, that they're not supposed --n401c2f to be dumping --n401c42,	###and i know for a fact that they get away with a lot that,###you know, they're supposed --n401248 to be regulated --n40125b because we have a, we have a plant, i don't know about t i but we have a plant, uh, a pillsbury plant, in, in a town adjacent to ours,###.###uh-huh.###.###and i know people that --n401571 work there that,###of course, you wouldn't think pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,###.###no.###.###but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the, um, what they do --n401729, uh, --n40173c to, uh, make their dough and st-, to, clean out the flour and stuff like that,###.###really.###.###yeah,###.###huh.###.###i mean, it's incredible.###and, um, they said that they're, you know, they have a little creek that --n401a42 runs by them
61086:46	so, i don't see, you know, how they can do some of the te- --n403f5f,	### but, uh, and they're, you know, they're right there on the creek also###and, uh, they've been there for years.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh,###.###but,###i mean, you think about it, it, you know,###it --n40380c's probably a lot easier --n403827 to detect things that --n403842 go into the ground than it --n403861 is maybe to just,###i'm not really sure###but i would think it --n403a13 would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean-, or stream or such,###.###yeah.###.###or you can, you can, you know, do, uh, testing on the ground itself at that point,###.###uh-huh.###.###but when they pollute into the air --n403d0f and you've got, you know, and you've got movement through the air --n403d56, it's going --n403d6d to move a lot of that off.
61208:34	and the, the ground will filter some of it but not all of it.	###.###and they're like, they're afraid that, you know, within a certain amount of years, that it's, their wa-, their water in that town will be totally polluted,###.###it will.###.###and they won't be able --n40674d to have any drinking water because they will have, um, polluted, completely polluted, so that they're, you know, there's too many toxins and bacterial growth,###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###and the gr-,###.###and i'm like my god, you know, just from that one, you know, just from them introducing dairy farms, in that one county.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###.###yeah,
61538:39	we, we were trying --n403a29 to find some pictures of him recently.	###well,###.###uh, i, i just knew today, uh, you know, that we looked at the pound, and that we just went all over the place,###and i knew we were going --n403255 to find him, you know,###and when we didn't --n403325 it was, like, oh, no,.###so i don't know.###.###well, i, i'll, i hope you'll find him.###you most likely will.###.###yeah,###we keep, you know,###they told us like at the humane society and the adoption center, you know, don't give up hope, you know,###and then,###well, not yet.###.###well, have you put any posters up or anything like that.###.###we were talking about that tonight since, you know, he, we just, he just got out yesterday###we were just talking about that whether
61752:73	so, uh, we got, we, we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it, you know, so that he couldn't get out.	###oh, boy.###.###well, see, he did, he did it a couple weeks ago, dug a hole,###and, you know, we, we filled it back up put him back in there.###.###uh-huh.###.###he did it again###.###uh-huh.###.###so we chained him up###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, but we really didn't want --n407acf to keep him chained --n407ae6 up because, you know, we feel like that's just too restricting for him.###.###right,###right.###.
61846:24	and we named him buddy beaner for some reason.	###what --n40928a's his name,###did you call.###.###buddy.###.###buddy.###.###uh-huh.###.### we, that's was our cat --n409387's name that, that, that --n4093b6 died.###.###is that right.###.###oh, yeah.### we named him, uh, we named him buddy after, uh, buddy bell, uh, the ranger baseball player that --n40958c used --n409597 to be here.###.###oh.###.###and we used --n409706 to,###we were really into that when we got him --n409779 going to the ranger games,
61917:28	and also i'm interested in writing some programs that --n4009c5 will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that wednesdays is trash day and the like.	###my wife works out of the home, our home.###she has an office###and in fact she sits in the office###and she uses it to compose and print out letters.###.###okay,###well now.###.###so that's a very regular use of it that she has --n40062d.###.###uh-huh.###.###and in addition to that i tinker around with it.###i'm a computer scientist.###.###oh.###.### and so i write programs --n4007e5 to do little things###i'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things###nothing special.
62101:38	and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing.	###.###one and one equals ten.###.###yeah,###that's great.###.###course it's it's kind of an inside joke, you know.###.###yeah.###.###you can only tell that to somebody who --n4043be understands binary.###.###i understand,###that's great,###that's a good joke.###.###so what, do you, uh, uh, work with a computers a at t i.###.###i did for years###and then i was a scientist over in central research labs
62192:35	but i've, i've got some opinions on it.	###yeah,###mike you take care now.###.###good day.###.###good luck to you.###.### thank you.###same to you.###.###.###huh.###okay.###.###i don't know how much --n40005e i know --n40006d about this subject.###.###well, i don't know if i know anything or not,###.###yeah.###.
62219:4	some type of college, uh, volunteer work for teachers, that --n400cbf they are straight out of college	###yeah.###.###well, uh, i've had teenagers###and i now have grandchildren that --n4004cd are teenagers,###and i don't know that it --n400568 might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective.###uh, i think this" me" generation has gone far too far.###and the young people are overly impressed.###and i think it --n4007b1 wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a m-, far more disadvantaged viewpoint.###.###that's true.###.###uh, i personally know nothing about the peace corps though.###.###um, me either.### i, i went to college and then started --n400a6a working and then got married --n400a85###and,###.###but they have,###i read somewhere,###and i'm, i'm out on a limb here,
62250:4	some group paid part of his college income	###oh, really.###.###uh-huh.###if it's like, you know, really a, you know, a lower paying job, you know, where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as --n40145b to, you know, to live --n40147e.###.###and this is money that she's borrowed --n4016b7 to form her college education.###.###yeah,###she only taught there one year###but i,###.###but she got credits for it.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's very interesting.###.###and, um, i think it would be,###i know that also one of my cousins who, uh, --n401988 he is in like the therapy type thing###and he was, um,
62272:40	you know, if, if we had some really major health problem that --n402552 required a specialist, we could find one	###i mean, it's a nursing home or something like that.###.###huh.###.###so, you know, if,###i think that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns --n401df9 to work by --n401e0c helping people that --n401e1f normally might not be able --n401e3a to go to college and get the type of degree they want --n401e75.###.###yeah,###i think that is an excellent program,###i really do.###i like that.###and it's, it's beneficial to the small towns too because, they really, really have, have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand --n402245 because we're in the metroplex.###.###yeah.###.###.###as far as ge-, yeah, getting doctors and all that stuff,###yeah.###.###right,
62367:58	but say, i think bangladesh --n4046c3 would have been a good example or some, some really desperate situation	###i don't know that that would work if, somebody's, was, didn't really want --n403e78 to be there and didn't have,###.###every time you,###.###.###they could buy their way out.###.###yeah,###i mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else.###.###right,###you know, they, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat.###but,, i'm wondering if there's another issue here,###and maybe this is why this has died out --n404347.###can you go into,###and this wasn't the question###but it's, it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults,###can they go in there###and can anyone go into, well, out of###the kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time,
62433:93	and maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required --n40607d to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states --n4060dc.	###yeah.###.###so, i, i'm wondering if the peace corps is, really an effective tool.###.###well,###.###.###down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that --n405bdf aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think --n405c2a probably need help and, could be helped --n405c51 --n405c58.###.###good point.###.###.###we've got enough without lea-, without a passport###there's plenty.###.###yeah.###.###yes.###i think we ought --n405f3b to worry about our own species.###.
62433:134	and maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required --n40607d to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states --n4060dc.	###yeah.###.###so, i, i'm wondering if the peace corps is, really an effective tool.###.###well,###.###.###down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that --n405bdf aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think --n405c2a probably need help and, could be helped --n405c51 --n405c58.###.###good point.###.###.###we've got enough without lea-, without a passport###there's plenty.###.###yeah.###.###yes.###i think we ought --n405f3b to worry about our own species.###.
62437:24	but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.	###well,###.###.###down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that --n405bdf aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think --n405c2a probably need help and, could be helped --n405c51 --n405c58.###.###good point.###.###.###we've got enough without lea-, without a passport###there's plenty.###.###yeah.###.###yes.###i think we ought --n405f3b to worry about our own species.###.###and maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required --n40607d to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states --n4060dc.###.###i wonder now in,###and i've been out of school too long to answer this,
62502:62	so, we're a little fa-, you know, farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing --n407ee7.	###.###yeah,###i mean it's,###.###.###true.###yeah.###.###i think that's a lot more realistic.###uh, i, i think that we should be spending more time### and, and again i don't think the, the peace corps is, is as successful now simply because it's not. it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.###.###yeah.###.###uh, we've got plenty,###in fact, we've got far too many.###you're in, uh, what r-, flower mound.###.###flower mound,###yeah.
62525:23	so, we'll talk about that some.	###that's exactly what i was going --n4080a4 to ask you --n4080b7.### have you ever, have, have you been downtown recent-,###.###.###uh, i guess i've had --n400032 to return something###but i'm ca-, can't decide,###mostly it's been because i didn't like the color,###.###uh-huh.###.###or, um, i'm not sure whether i've had --n400233 to return that many things, uh,###.###well, i'm having a problem --n400321 right now with a computer that we've just returned --n400350.###.###oh, are you.###.###so, for me it's actually a pretty good topic.###.###okay,###good,
62581:54	well, we bought a computer because my husband needed --n4012e8 to use it to do some work for a consulting project,	###there you go --n400fe9.###.###all right.### it, it'll come to us,###okay..###.###okay.###.###are you ready.###.###yeah.###.###laurie, all right.###.###right.###.###all right, uh,### tell me about your computer, laurie,###i think that sounds fascinating.###.
62647:7	in some ways it has more --n402b87 to do with the people who --n402ba6 sold it.	###so we used it a bit,###but we tried --n40252d to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need --n402568 to be able --n40257b to put at least three in.###.###huh.###.###and,###.###oh, no,###the computer was supposed --n402737 to have two.###.###well, it has them###but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need --n40282c to put in it, in it. and even though they told us in advance that you could,###.###oh, i see.###.###they told us there would be no problem because, you know, the salesman just doesn't really know.###.###i see.###.###.
62690:49	and they say they can, you know, do something different and change some connectors	###my husband goes --n4034d4 to pick it up last week###and we couldn't go --n403567 get it sooner because i just had the baby,###and, you know, life's just a little bit complicated.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, he goes and gets it, brings it home,###first of all they're missing components of it like cables###so you can't really test it out.###and then second thing, we still can't put the boards in, because they have other things blocking where we need --n403904 to do it --n403917.###.###oh, jeez.###.###.###huh.###.###and see now we're dealing with having --n403a93 to bring it back again
62707:16	so, well, actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card	###huh.###.###and see now we're dealing with having --n403a93 to bring it back again###and they say they can, you know, do something different and change some connectors###and we hope so,###but it's a hassle.###.###yeah,###it really is.###.### you kn-, you know, it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what --n403d66 goes on.###.###right,### and, and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction.###.###right.###.###i think that's the worst part.###i,###.
62717:78	but that's one thing --n4044c8 to be said --n4044db for credit. it, how, it gets you some muscle where you need it --n404522 --n404529.	### you kn-, you know, it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what --n403d66 goes on.###.###right,### and, and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction.###.###right.###.###i think that's the worst part.###i,###.###so, well, actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card###and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation,###and they said, well, you don't have --n4041fa to pay for it yet.###.###now that's an advantage, isn't it.###.###yes.###.###it really is.###i think, uh, uh, there's a lot --n4043ca not to be said for credit
62767:31	but to keep her entertained, music and some of these things do help.	###.###.###that's right.###they will,###.###yeah.###.###they will put the kind of clout --n404e53 on them that you can't really do --n404e7a.###.###right.###.###yeah.###.###and,###.###we,###hal bought me, uh, uh, small, uh, well, uh, uh,, little jam box kind of thing###so i'd,### my, i have my ninety-three year old mother living with us,###and so i, she doesn't remember anything
62771:99	and i thought well, if i had, uh, a nic-, a nice little, um, tape recorder, you know, so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while. and then also so that i can, uh, uh, copy, uh, parts off, i, i do some musicals and things like this and if i can copy sections off that i can use --n4054aa someplace so i figured well this will be good.	###.###yeah.###.###they will put the kind of clout --n404e53 on them that you can't really do --n404e7a.###.###right.###.###yeah.###.###and,###.###we,###hal bought me, uh, uh, small, uh, well, uh, uh,, little jam box kind of thing###so i'd,### my, i have my ninety-three year old mother living with us,###and so i, she doesn't remember anything###but to keep her entertained, music and some of these things do help.###.###uh-huh.###.
62817:18	do you buy it at some major store.	###so i, i wish i could tell you###i really don't know which brand it is --n406379.###it's,###.###but i was wondering like, you know###in our case where we knew we were buying a copy --n4064c2###we weren't buying, on i b m p c###.###yeah.###.###and i was wondering if you,###.###no,### i think this is a, i think this is maybe a name brand###and i suspect that it's probably, just a fluke, you know.###i have the papers and everything###and we're going --n406888 to get, just take it back###but, uh,###.###uh-huh.
63072:28	and then i was having --n401e09 to work some real late hours --n401e28 to get caught with my work after i got out of class.	###.###and they run for two months at a time.###and you have --n401674 to, you do have --n40168f to pay --n40169e to take them.###and i took, i signed up for one that --n4017a9 was three nights a week, an hour and a half,###so that was four and a half hours a week.###.###oh.###.###and it cost sixty dollars,###and i thought, okay, that's not cheap,###that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money.###.###right.###.###and i had a friend of mine going,###so i was real good,###i only missed it about three times.###and then, oh, march came around,###and i signed up again,###and i got, uh, caught --n401d00 up with a class i was taking --n401d27 at t i,
63076:40	and then i went to colorado springs the next week --n401f95 to do some training at the t i up there.	###so that was four and a half hours a week.###.###oh.###.###and it cost sixty dollars,###and i thought, okay, that's not cheap,###that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money.###.###right.###.###and i had a friend of mine going,###so i was real good,###i only missed it about three times.###and then, oh, march came around,###and i signed up again,###and i got, uh, caught --n401d00 up with a class i was taking --n401d27 at t i,###and then i was having --n401e09 to work some real late hours --n401e28 to get caught with my work after i got out of class.###.###uh-huh.###.
63108:7	and some of them require me to go out of town,	###we went in --n402445 together and hired a private instructor,###and she came to our school twice a week.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, i, i was,###i would go faithfully,###and then i missed once.###.###.###then i went back again a couple times and missed another time, and then kept --n4026a4 missing and never went back again.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think, if you, you just have --n4027d9 to stick with it.###.###oh, yeah.###i think i've been two maybe three times the month of april,###and this session is about --n4029b1 to run out.###now i signed up for a different one --n402a42 now that --n402a51's only two nights a week because i am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as --n402aa8 teaching a lot of training classes
63151:14	i mean, some i,	###so, i'm kind of finding excuses,###and now it's kind of like, well, this is the last week.###i'll just start fresh next week.###but, i better, better --n40332f do it.###and i think another thing is that my friend that --n4033e3 was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months.###she started --n403516 taking tennis lessons,###and so i haven't had that extra motivation, of, of us forcing each other, or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go.###.###yeah.###.###so.###.###sure,###yeah###that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with --n4037e9 and --n4037f8 to do the same the same thing --n40381b.###.###uh-huh.###.###like it's misery loves company.###i don't really love exercise.
63221:32	um, it's a lot more fun than some other things i could do --n4050af, i guess --n4050c6.	###.###right.###yeah,###walking is kind of boring.###i do have a few friends that --n40496c live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood,###and we try --n404a3c to, we used --n404a53 to try --n404a62 to get together,###and i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going --n404b74 to start --n404b83 doing it again and occasionally go --n404ba2 walking.###there's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###and it's not as boring if you get several people###.###that's right.###.###and you can kind of talk,### and, and it, it makes it pass pretty quickly,###and the aerobics isn't too boring.###i kind of enjoy it when i'm doing it --n404fef.
63387:16	uh, they have some during, during lunch hour that --n4086e6 are shorter,	###and it's, it's a pretty nice setup.###um, and of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work.###i think if i had --n407f90 to come home and then go somewhere, i'd never make it.###.###yeah.###.###and just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the, the recreation center and do it helps a lot.###.###uh-huh.###yeah,###i can see that would be, uh, easy.###they make it as easy --n4082eb as they possibly can for you.###.###oh, yeah.###.###well, um, do a lot of people take advantage of it.###.###quite a few do.###they have probably, ooh, i'd say --n4084e5 fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that --n40851c are running,###and they have them anywhere from six in the morning.
63398:14	they even have some late night ones for people that --n408c06 work second shift and things like that.	###they make it as easy --n4082eb as they possibly can for you.###.###oh, yeah.###.###well, um, do a lot of people take advantage of it.###.###quite a few do.###they have probably, ooh, i'd say --n4084e5 fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that --n40851c are running,###and they have them anywhere from six in the morning.###uh, they have some during, during lunch hour that --n4086e6 are shorter,###and i guess guys can take advantage of that.###for me, i wouldn't have time to do an hour, hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get, get dressed --n4088c1 again --n4088cc.###.###oh, yeah.###.###but there's a lot more guys that --n408a81 do that one.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, they have them, you know, in the evenings,
63400:13	they even have some, uh, aerobic, uh, water aerobics when the weather gets nice --n408d74 out in the pool.	###oh, yeah.###.###well, um, do a lot of people take advantage of it.###.###quite a few do.###they have probably, ooh, i'd say --n4084e5 fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that --n40851c are running,###and they have them anywhere from six in the morning.###uh, they have some during, during lunch hour that --n4086e6 are shorter,###and i guess guys can take advantage of that.###for me, i wouldn't have time to do an hour, hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get, get dressed --n4088c1 again --n4088cc.###.###oh, yeah.###.###but there's a lot more guys that --n408a81 do that one.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, they have them, you know, in the evenings,###they even have some late night ones for people that --n408c06 work second shift and things like that.###so they have big variety.
63417:44	and i think they're working on --n409433 building a jogging track and some other things.	###and, um, they have them, you know, in the evenings,###they even have some late night ones for people that --n408c06 work second shift and things like that.###so they have big variety.###they even have some, uh, aerobic, uh, water aerobics when the weather gets nice --n408d74 out in the pool.###i've never done that one before.###but.###.###oh, you have a pool there, too.###.###uh-huh.###.###oh, how nice.###.###they've got an olympic pool, and, and basketball courts and sand volleyball.###they've got the full weight room and, uh, the locker rooms with, uh, a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities, and hair dryers, and all the, you know, everything you'd need --n409128 just about.###.###wow.###.### it's a real, it is a real nice facility.###it's also got a full insid-, inside basketball court,
63485:16	and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter.	###.###how should they do it --n400128.###why didn't it work last time --n400194.###.###and why didn't it work last time --n40020a..###.###well, i'm all for it.###.###yeah,###well, i, i am too.###i wish, uh, it had started a long time ago, is the problem, because we're so wound up in the in the system that we've got --n4003fa that, you know, trying --n40041d to convert over,###.###yeah.###.###and i guess, what'd they try --n400633, they tried what'd the call it --n40065e, soft conversion and hard conversion###.###yeah,###they tried the,###.###one of them is where you just take whatever --n40080b's already standard --n40081e
63544:94	i would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age, you know, under the age of thirty or so, to have some idea what it is --n40219f, anyway.	###so, uh.###.### that, that's the problem.###.###when we finally out that liters was about a quart --n401bd6, there's about four liters in a gallon###so you can figure out what you're actually paying --n401cef for it.###.###right.###it --n401daa's kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age,###i don't know,###when i was growing up --n401ed2, we were talking metric system in school.###i mean, not, not at first,###.###uh-huh.###.###but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade --n40205b anyway.###.###yeah.###oh.###.
63606:10	and then some of them are done --n4038ec in, you know, purely metric.	###.###and.###.###and one of the things that we've run into --n403389 a problem,###course you're familiar with the t i drawing,###well, with any drawing system you end up with, you end up with things in inches in parts of inches, you know, half, fourth, you know, this sort of thing.###.###right.###mils and microns.###.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###and then you end up with a decimal, where you start --n4037a8 getting into mils, and that sort of thing --n4037d3.###.###right.###.
63642:29	you know, i guess that's some	###so.###.### the, uh, the one that, uh, uh,###have you ever lived in a country where they use metric --n403f4b.###.###no.###.###i was with t i in el salvador for a while,###and i had --n40408d to get used to, you know, purely metric system down there, because they didn't understand anything else.###you know, if you start --n4041e2 talking about miles, they'd look at you like, what.###.###yeah.###.###so, i had a little bit of experience with it,###and also i noticed in canada they, uh, you drop a quarter, fifty cents, whatever, in a coke machine up there,###and you get this funny looking coke, you know,###it's in a can that --n404591's that --n4045a0's taller but not as big around.###.###yeah.###.
63704:23	now, okay, we run into some problems once,	###yeah,###something like that.###.###yeah,###so. i, i think as long as people have a choice, they're going --n40588a to stick with the american way.###.###uh-huh.###.###and until we have to, have --n4059e0 to learn --n4059ef to think that way, we won't.###.###yeah.###though we call it the english system,###but i'm not sure what they do --n405ba7 in england now.### they're, they're on metric, aren't they.###.###yeah,###for the most part, i think so.###.###yeah,###except they've got a,
63804:6	and some are in kilometers.	###well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour, you know,###they could've converted it to metric just about as easy.###.###yeah,###i think they,###you got the problem with all your cars are still,###yeah,###you still got cars on the road that --n4082d1 don't have both.###.###yeah.###.###at that time, anyway, that was still when things were,###the metric system was still not,###.###not all that common.###.###you know, now cars, they have both.###sooner or later they'll start --n408565 putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start --n4085a8 thinking that way.###.###i know the only other place that i was ever at --n4086dc where they really had it mixed --n4086fb was, was in panama, where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in, in miles per hour --n40876a
63816:17	and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, um, plastic, um, i think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatev-, whatever other combination there is --n400289.	###the metric system was still not,###.###not all that common.###.###you know, now cars, they have both.###sooner or later they'll start --n408565 putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start --n4085a8 thinking that way.###.###i know the only other place that i was ever at --n4086dc where they really had it mixed --n4086fb was, was in panama, where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in, in miles per hour --n40876a###and some are in kilometers.###and you got --n4089b7 to know where you are --n4089d2 because anything that --n4089e5 was the old canal zone is going --n408a08 to be miles per hour,###.###yeah.###.###.### start.###.###what kind of recycling programs do you have --n40005f in rowlett.###.###um, th-,###well right now they've got a, kind of a central location off of the main highway,
63819:61	and, and i think they've got a comp-, uh, some kind of container for aluminum.	###.###you know, now cars, they have both.###sooner or later they'll start --n408565 putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start --n4085a8 thinking that way.###.###i know the only other place that i was ever at --n4086dc where they really had it mixed --n4086fb was, was in panama, where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in, in miles per hour --n40876a###and some are in kilometers.###and you got --n4089b7 to know where you are --n4089d2 because anything that --n4089e5 was the old canal zone is going --n408a08 to be miles per hour,###.###yeah.###.###.### start.###.###what kind of recycling programs do you have --n40005f in rowlett.###.###um, th-,###well right now they've got a, kind of a central location off of the main highway,###and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, um, plastic, um, i think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatev-, whatever other combination there is --n400289.###.###.
63913:49	and i think they're trying --n402903 to, to make some changes.	###.###uh-huh.###.###and they put them right near where they have the time cards --n4024c3.###.###yeah.###.###and it works great.###and they have one in the room where the snack machines are --n4025d1 too.###.###that's good.###.###so they're really going at it,###and i think it's marvelous because,###.###yeah.### i, i guess rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is --n4027ec.###.###well,###.
63963:29	i, i wonder about some of the prod-, products that they don't take --n4040e8, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take --n404123. uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those --n404162.	###yeah.###.###that was surprising to me.###.###um.###.###i missed that question, totally, i mean really bad.###i'm trying --n403ab0 to think,###i didn't miss too many,###i can't remember what my score was --n403b89,###but i did exceeding well.###i was surprised.###but i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed --n403ca6.###that was a shocker to me.###.###yeah,###well there are a lot of things that --n403db8 aren't,###i'm,###that's, uh, one of the things i wonder about --n403ebb,###uh, one of the questions was, do you think more --n403f8d should be done --n403fa0, or something else.
63963:80	i, i wonder about some of the prod-, products that they don't take --n4040e8, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take --n404123. uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those --n404162.	###yeah.###.###that was surprising to me.###.###um.###.###i missed that question, totally, i mean really bad.###i'm trying --n403ab0 to think,###i didn't miss too many,###i can't remember what my score was --n403b89,###but i did exceeding well.###i was surprised.###but i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed --n403ca6.###that was a shocker to me.###.###yeah,###well there are a lot of things that --n403db8 aren't,###i'm,###that's, uh, one of the things i wonder about --n403ebb,###uh, one of the questions was, do you think more --n403f8d should be done --n403fa0, or something else.

65910:42	i would like --n401bb5 to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems. and to come up with something a little better than what we've got --n401c4c.	###well, see the other way i'm thinking about --n401021 is they should be self-supporting, like, uh, the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons. anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves --n4010b0.###in other words, they're in there for a purpose,### put them to work rather than sitting there.###.###uh-huh.###.###it's the same thing like the whole criminal, i shouldn't say --n4013dc criminal, but the whole police department of the united states.###i feel the same way.###uh, someone gets picked --n401559 up for drunk driving, he should put enough --n401584 in there that --n401597 goes back into --n4015aa paying for that policeman being out there.###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's self defen-, you know, self-defense on that point.###uh, as far as my defense budget, uh, they're cutting it back now, what, twenty-five percent.###i wouldn't want --n4018fc to see it cut --n401913 any more than that.###.###yeah.###.###but again i'd like --n4019ef to see something on the other end back into education. but not in the education we have --n401a42 today.###so i'm lost on that one.
65927:55	but i'm just saying that even the differences, uh, is that, you know, some countries pay for students to go to, through college and etcetera.	###.###but again i'd like --n4019ef to see something on the other end back into education. but not in the education we have --n401a42 today.###so i'm lost on that one.###i would like --n401bb5 to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems. and to come up with something a little better than what we've got --n401c4c.###.###uh-huh.###yeah,###it --n401e15's tough to, to say what, uh, you know, what, uh,###as far as this, that good or bad or what.###but, uh, i was just talking to somebody else,###and all those european countries, they pay all the way through college and stuff like that.###they,###so, uh,###.###well, not so much pay.###i'm not trying --n40220f to see the government put out any more.###.###no.###yeah,###i know what you are saying --n402304.
65989:12	so we had some interference,	###you know, they want somebody --n403d59, you know, when they then, when they bring them off, bring them in --n403db0, that --n403dbf they have something, you know, a certain amount to contribute --n403dfe.###obviously, there's, uh, you know, there's a lot to learn --n404055, uh, after that.### but, but, uh, that's true.### i'm, i'm sure there's a lot of, uh, you know,###businesses are small, you know, small businesses that --n404344 could, uh.### let me change my channel,###i've got a cordless phone.### let me see if that clears this up.###is that better.###.###yes.###.###okay.###.###wow.###.###mumblex###yeah,###it was a cordless phone,###and all of a sudden we had a bad, uh, frequency --n404685 there or something.
65999:146	but, uh, you know, i think, uh, they, maybe they need --n404923 to, uh, help --n40493e promote that more. give incentives like, uh, if they do bring somebody on, they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is --n4049c5, you know, for them to train people, you know, stuff like that.	###yes.###.###okay.###.###wow.###.###mumblex###yeah,###it was a cordless phone,###and all of a sudden we had a bad, uh, frequency --n404685 there or something.###so we had some interference,###so i changed that.###.###yeah.###it sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere.###.###anyway, so, uh,###.###well,###.
66008:25	but see, that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people. at people, per, at high school level, which i would like --n405191 to see --n4051a0. rather than so many kids getting out of school.	###and all of a sudden we had a bad, uh, frequency --n404685 there or something.###so we had some interference,###so i changed that.###.###yeah.###it sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere.###.###anyway, so, uh,###.###well,###.###but, uh, you know, i think, uh, they, maybe they need --n404923 to, uh, help --n40493e promote that more. give incentives like, uh, if they do bring somebody on, they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is --n4049c5, you know, for them to train people, you know, stuff like that.###programs like that, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.###i don't know, you know, what kind of options they've got --n404d94.###.###well, that's something about what germany's supposed --n404e6c to be doing --n404e7f. something similar to that right now.###and, uh, they have jobs out on, you know, bulletin boards so people know what --n404fd9 is open for an apprentices in different fields.
66134:57	i, uh, i'm trying my best right now --n401580 to pay off some of mine.	###and that's, that's how a lot of people get into trouble --n400d32.###.###yeah.### i've got, i've got two that i, you know, that usually i'll have a balance on --n400e78.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then all of the others i just try --n400fff to use --n40100e kind of like you would an american express card and, and pay it off every month.###.###right.###.###and that way i feel like i'm getting, you know, a thirty day loan.###.###yeah.###.###but i don't have --n4012a4 to worry about, you know, --n4012c7 running them up --n4012da too high, except at christmas.### then they usually go, then they usually get run --n401406 up pretty good.###.###yeah.###well, you have a lot of discipline.
66139:35	and, uh, but still i have some that --n4017c3 are, are up to the limit.	###uh-huh.###.###and then all of the others i just try --n400fff to use --n40100e kind of like you would an american express card and, and pay it off every month.###.###right.###.###and that way i feel like i'm getting, you know, a thirty day loan.###.###yeah.###.###but i don't have --n4012a4 to worry about, you know, --n4012c7 running them up --n4012da too high, except at christmas.### then they usually go, then they usually get run --n401406 up pretty good.###.###yeah.###well, you have a lot of discipline.### i, uh, i'm trying my best right now --n401580 to pay off some of mine.### i, i've, i've paid off about four credit cards this year.###.###uh-huh.###.
66483:25	what --n400e1c's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.	###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, i've seen, uh, a lot of people get convicted, sentenced --n4006d4,###and then just nothing --n4007ac happens, just endless, endless, endless appeals.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh,###well from what i underst-,###i saw a statistic --n4008e6 just a few days ago, um, so far this ye-, year, or was it during the last year, somewh-, during a year's time, i think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation.###meanwhile, there were twenty-five hundred people on death row.###.###.###so i, i,###and it's building up, you know,### they're, they're convicting them faster than they're executing them###so it's really building up.###.###yeah,
66700:13	you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges	###i kind of, uh, stopped --n406854 listening after a while.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, you know, he would come home### and, and, you know, after the trial was over he came home and told us what --n4069bf was going on###and of course then they had --n406ae0 to go back --n406af3 to dec-, you know,###after he had --n406bcd to go,###.### the, the penalty phase,###yeah,###they've, decide the penalty separately from the verdict.###.###right.###and, uh, yeah everybody, everybody was pretty much, you know, let's burn him.###.###uh-huh.###.###and that's, you know, that's the way they wanted --n406ec7 to do it --n406eda.###and he was surprised because he thought there was going --n406ffe to be a problem because he, uh,
66700:68	you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges	###i kind of, uh, stopped --n406854 listening after a while.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, you know, he would come home### and, and, you know, after the trial was over he came home and told us what --n4069bf was going on###and of course then they had --n406ae0 to go back --n406af3 to dec-, you know,###after he had --n406bcd to go,###.### the, the penalty phase,###yeah,###they've, decide the penalty separately from the verdict.###.###right.###and, uh, yeah everybody, everybody was pretty much, you know, let's burn him.###.###uh-huh.###.###and that's, you know, that's the way they wanted --n406ec7 to do it --n406eda.###and he was surprised because he thought there was going --n406ffe to be a problem because he, uh,
66757:23	there are some, some other crimes that i think, uh, you know, uh,	###but it, it's not worth somebody getting executed --n4083d6 for.###but we hear so much about the violence and how it --n4084ae's not safe to walk the streets because somebody, you know, these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###and the people i'd most likely want --n4086bf to sentence --n4086ce to death are the people that --n4086ed just show a really low regard for human life.###that, you know,###you, never know when they're going --n4088a7 to turn or hurt the next person --n4088ca because it --n4088d9 doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt --n40890c or not.###.###yeah,###yeah,###i agree.###.###and so i go, le-,###these are the kind of people i would like --n408b54 to ye-, get --n408b77 out of here and get --n408b92 out of circulation and say i don't, we don't accept your kind in our society.###.###yeah,###i agree,### i, i've, i have, uh, a low tolerance for that kind of, uh, that kind of person.###and, uh, as far as, uh, you know
66763:14	but, um, some of these people are just out and out brutal.	###that, you know,###you, never know when they're going --n4088a7 to turn or hurt the next person --n4088ca because it --n4088d9 doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt --n40890c or not.###.###yeah,###yeah,###i agree.###.###and so i go, le-,###these are the kind of people i would like --n408b54 to ye-, get --n408b77 out of here and get --n408b92 out of circulation and say i don't, we don't accept your kind in our society.###.###yeah,###i agree,### i, i've, i have, uh, a low tolerance for that kind of, uh, that kind of person.###and, uh, as far as, uh, you know###there are some, some other crimes that i think, uh, you know, uh,###kidnapping, um, you know, when they,###i mean kidnapping per se has a certain, uh, uh, fine and penalty associated with it,###.###uh-huh.###.
66765:5	some of the cases i've heard about --n4093c2 over the years,	###.###yeah,###yeah,###i agree.###.###and so i go, le-,###these are the kind of people i would like --n408b54 to ye-, get --n408b77 out of here and get --n408b92 out of circulation and say i don't, we don't accept your kind in our society.###.###yeah,###i agree,### i, i've, i have, uh, a low tolerance for that kind of, uh, that kind of person.###and, uh, as far as, uh, you know###there are some, some other crimes that i think, uh, you know, uh,###kidnapping, um, you know, when they,###i mean kidnapping per se has a certain, uh, uh, fine and penalty associated with it,###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, some of these people are just out and out brutal.###i,
67111:45	and some, some of the people, uh, some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too, are picking up some of those great big houses,	###and everybody in their late twenties to mid-thirties are buying, and, and starting --n404bee to rebuild and fix things up again###speakeranan*t72-2.###.###and everybody is real excited.###.###oh, that's, that's wonderful.###.###yeah.###.###speakera76-1*t76-1.###that is a gorgeous, gorgeous place.###speakerbnan*t76-1.###speakerb76-2*t76-2.###oh, it's, it's a lot of fun,###the people are great.###there too, we've got a real active neighborhood association.###and uh, we have, well, we've got four regular parties every year###and we do a neighborhood recycling program and, all that kind of stuff.###so, it's a lot of fun###and it is, it's a really beautiful area.

67393:119	uh, so i've been doing that less, and, and concentrating more on, you know, light biking when i get home on the evening --n401aa5 and then, you know, some more on the weekends.	###.### how d-, how does that work, work out with, uh, storing your bike and showering and all that --n4010bc.###.###yeah,###it can be a pain.###uh, basically, uh, i work on a campus###so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the, uh, campus to the, uh, gym, use the shower there###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, but, it's, it's enough of a pain, that i did it consistently one year,###i would commute every day, uh,###but it just became such a pain.###i mean we're talking, you know, forty-five, fifty minutes for biking, uh, and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind.###and then another half an hour, you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff --n4017bd.###.###right.###.###it was a big hunk, hunk of the day.###uh, and then of course another hour to get back home --n401996.
67466:21	they want --n403486 to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour.	###.###it --n402e0b's good to have a partner.###.###yeah###it really is.###.###are you think of --n402f02 doing any, like, centuries, or...###.###yeah,###that would be cool sometime if i could, you know, work up to that.###.###uh-huh.###yeah,###i just wondered if you were going --n4030f0 to do that --n403103 mostly or more like, you know, uh, uh, touring like from vermont or, you know, that kind of, thing.###.###oh.###.###i mean people seem --n4032ff to get into different aspects.###one is more of a distance,###and one's more, just, you know,
67607:18	i mean there are some people,	###that's good.###.###yeah.###.###you say you ride about a hundred, hundred fifty miles a week.###.###yeah.###.###man.### that's, that's hard-core.###.###on average,###yeah.###.###when do you get --n405e85 to begin with the winters and all that --n405eac.###what time of the year do you usually embark on your,###do you ride inside if you can't ride outside.###.###no,###i'm not that hard-core.
67780:49	and the dog was being house sit --n401893, or dog sit --n4018aa, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,	###.###wow.###.###um, but he had actually was able --n4013d0 to get him over that.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then he was gaining weight again, was just getting healthy,###and, uh, he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing###and then he got hit --n4015fe by a cadillac.###.###oh no.###.###so, i couldn't believe it.### that was, that was really hard.###.###oh, gee.###.###and that was even harder for,###i was on a business trip at the time
67949:38	well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the,	###yeah.###.###and, uh, this golden retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current,###and, uh.###.###oh, no.###.###well no,###actually he had no trouble at all.###he first jumped in###and i,### he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really,###i don't think he'd swum before.###.###really.###.###but he jumped in, in the, the river.###.###did puppy go to.###.
68149:17	you know for quite some time, just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty.	###not critical at all.###.###no,###no.###.###yeah,###they're really wonderful.###.###yeah,###well, it --n408917's been nice talking to you,###we seem --n4089be to be degenerating here,###so.###.###.###what's the, uh,### in texas law has a, uh, what does it have --n400094, it has a death penalty doesn't it.###.###oh, yes,###yeah.###they just, uh, started it again, too just late, or, within the past few years.
68271:50	but they, they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason.	###yes,###very true.### i, uh, i agree with you there.###uh, uh-huh.###.###i think i'd probably do it###but we could never say what we would do --n4033e1 if we're not in the circumstance.### it, that's, that's, that's a real easy thing to say that, oh, sure i would,###but i don't know.###.###well, i myself wouldn't want --n4036d5 to be on the jury like that.###uh, i, it, it's, uh, that's an awful lot to, uh, to expect --n403810 of a person,### to, uh, to kill somebody is what it amounts to --n4039c3.###.###well, yes,###but, you know, that's what they did --n403ade.###.###it,###true.###very true.
68308:15	now, there's some,	###yeah,###i agree it should be in effect.###also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement, uh,###so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect###but i want, maybe###well, i'd, i, now i have a problem with this, too.###i think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance.###.###oh, that's true.###well now any, uh, just believe in just about any state in the union, uh, uh, a death, uh, or, uh, yeah, death verdict is an automatic, uh, appeal.###.###that's correct.###it is,###it is.###.###and, uh, uh, yes,###i'm inclined --n40498c to agree with you.###i think so,###there should be a limit as to the number of appeals.###.
68658:19	but, if there are some people who --n400bf5 don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems --n400c2c to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.	###uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than i do.###.###uh, i think, i think, uh, s-, the system right now, you know, should, you know, is fine.###i think it should be by a jury.###i don't think the judge should have##, i mean he's just there kind of like the referee.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###uh, i don't, i don't even think that it should be unanimous either. uh,###.###well, what about the idea that one is only guilty, uh, when --n40091b proven --n400926 guilty beyond a reasonable doubt --n400941.###i thought that was the point of, uh, a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.
68658:113	but, if there are some people who --n400bf5 don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems --n400c2c to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.	###uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than i do.###.###uh, i think, i think, uh, s-, the system right now, you know, should, you know, is fine.###i think it should be by a jury.###i don't think the judge should have##, i mean he's just there kind of like the referee.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###uh, i don't, i don't even think that it should be unanimous either. uh,###.###well, what about the idea that one is only guilty, uh, when --n40091b proven --n400926 guilty beyond a reasonable doubt --n400941.###i thought that was the point of, uh, a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.
68757:42	i, i have, i have some friends who --n403db6 do expert wis-, witness testimony	###i definitely feel like we need --n4031fe to keep it at least unanimous because, uh, you know, there's the classic sort of to kill a mockingbird kind of story where you get, you know, jury which --n403295 can have all kinds of prejudices and things that, a judge at least officially isn't supposed --n4032e4 to have --n4032f3. though, of course they can, too --n403322.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much brow-, you know, browbeat the jury, a majority, in the, of the, a majority of the jury,###.###uh-huh.###.###that's hard to say --n403918.###uh, so, it's, it's, uh, you know, saying, well, look we don't like the way he looks --n4039fa###and, let's, uh, let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff.###.###right.###.###and you also get a lot of, uh,###juries are extremely, uh,###and from what i hear --n403d1c,
68760:108	and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that --n404308 was, uh, you know, har-, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corp-, corporation.	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much brow-, you know, browbeat the jury, a majority, in the, of the, a majority of the jury,###.###uh-huh.###.###that's hard to say --n403918.###uh, so, it's, it's, uh, you know, saying, well, look we don't like the way he looks --n4039fa###and, let's, uh, let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff.###.###right.###.###and you also get a lot of, uh,###juries are extremely, uh,###and from what i hear --n403d1c,### i, i have, i have some friends who --n403db6 do expert wis-, witness testimony###and they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional pitches, you know,###the prosecutor will want --n403fee to, oh, i don't know show the, show the mugging victim, you know, show what the nice person he was --n40406d and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim,
69408:35	oh, there's, there's some nice things in baltimore, you know,	###frederick has a, uh, has a minor league team that --n4085b4 plays in the same league with salem###and, uh, i think we may be seeing them this, weekend.###.###oh,###.###.###is that right up there in frederick.###.###yeah,###i think they're out of town.###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah.###uh, that's a nice little town actually, frederick, uh,###.###i've never been up there.###i've never visited baltimore.###i'd like --n408a14 to go --n408a23 just sight see a little bit sometime.###.
69594:80	well, i guess that's one of the positive things that --n40398e ha-, have come out of it, some of the employee assistance program.	###.###probably the, the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of, of --n403472 assessing for alcohol.###.###that's true.###.###and that's probably the biggest problem there is --n4035ff.###.###yeah.###i think so,###more than drugs.###and i know a lot of companies that --n403727 will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab.###.###yeah.###.###they would pay for an alcohol###.###uh-huh.###.###but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation.###.
69672:11	they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests.	###i'm amazed, at the things people, will do --n404a7a.###.###.###yeah.###.###it is amazing.###i guess there are people that --n404b79 do that.###and they are, those are expensive tests.###i'm, glad i never had --n404cbd to pay for one.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###it depends r-, r-, really on how, how strong a test it is --n404dee.###they've got different degrees, as far as, as how far back they can check --n404f30.###.###yeah.###i guess so.###.
69673:14	they've mumblex some companies that --n4050e4 are doing, uh, hair tests.	###.###.###yeah.###.###it is amazing.###i guess there are people that --n404b79 do that.###and they are, those are expensive tests.###i'm, glad i never had --n404cbd to pay for one.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###it depends r-, r-, really on how, how strong a test it is --n404dee.###they've got different degrees, as far as, as how far back they can check --n404f30.###.###yeah.###i guess so.###.###they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests.
69680:52	and they can apparently test, um, back a certain period of time. because mumblex some of the, the residue ends up in your hair follicles, you know,	###i'm, glad i never had --n404cbd to pay for one.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###it depends r-, r-, really on how, how strong a test it is --n404dee.###they've got different degrees, as far as, as how far back they can check --n404f30.###.###yeah.###i guess so.###.###they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests.###they've mumblex some companies that --n4050e4 are doing, uh, hair tests.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah.###well, that,###they'll pull out one of your hairs

69792:30	and, uh, you know, there's some my age	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, a lot of my family is in indiana.###that's where i'm originally from --n400c37.###.###yes.###.###so, um, we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the, um, at the lake and, uh, make a couple days of it.###.###well that sounds like fun,###do they all have the small children --n400eba too, that --n400ecd come.###.###yeah,###pretty much.###.###so all ages.###.###yeah
69793:18	and then there are some a lot younger, an, about four generations, i guess --n4010c0.	###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, a lot of my family is in indiana.###that's where i'm originally from --n400c37.###.###yes.###.###so, um, we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the, um, at the lake and, uh, make a couple days of it.###.###well that sounds like fun,###do they all have the small children --n400eba too, that --n400ecd come.###.###yeah,###pretty much.###.###so all ages.###.###yeah###and, uh, you know, there's some my age
70059:21	well at least you've got some.	###uh-huh.###.###and, um, we usually get a fog. uh, right about, i guess, about four o'clock###and it kind of rolls in over the coast.###and, uh, then it usually breaks back off again the next morning.###and if you go just a little bit ways in, i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards salinas, uh, the weather completely changes###.###uh-huh.###.###and it gets very hot and dry###and the fog never makes it that far.###.###uh-huh.###.###but along here it's, uh, very, very different from the texas type weather.###what's it like --n4010ec down there.###.###well, right now we're we're having the little bit of spring that we have --n401191.###.###oh, really,
70109:22	and, uh, there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way.	###yeah.###it's not really been too bad.###.###uh-huh.###.###usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier.###.###uh-huh.###so do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year.###.###yeah,###quite a bit.###.###oh, uh-huh.###.###well, the season --n401bc4 is just about over for that,###uh, in fact we drove down to corpus last week###.###uh-huh.###.
70123:18	at least y'all are getting some rain up in dallas.	###.###well, the season --n401bc4 is just about over for that,###uh, in fact we drove down to corpus last week###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way.###.###oh, i miss that.###.###mumblex drove through san antonio###and i spoke to somebody else --n401e62 this morning from san antonio###and were,###they had,###and we came back.###what day was that --n401f96,###sunday evening,###and they had a big rainstorm --n40200d come through there, part of the same thing we're getting --n402048 now, i guess.###.###oh. oh, well that's real nice because i can remember two years ago that --n40219d in about february the hundred degree weather started in san antonio and just continued.
70200:18	well, we could use some rain up here.	###.###uh-huh.###.###you know.###.###yeah.###san antonio has that same problem when the rains come --n403188.### it's, it's a complete mess,###everything --n40328a floods, all the under passes.###.###yeah.###.###i didn't realize that dallas had that same problem.###.###yeah.###we have it,###especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years.###and there's a section in south dallas that --n4034d6's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain.###.###uh-huh.
70287:10	we get some when it's this rainy --n405125,	###.###yeah.###to the heat.###i really don't miss the heat.###.###yeah.###.###um, we do a lot of, you know,###when you do a lot of outside, like running and stuff --n404e7a, it's just so much easier, up here###.###uh-huh.###.###and you don't have --n404f94 to worry about the high humidity.###.###yeah.###.###does dallas get high humidity.###or is it pretty dry.###.###it's pretty dry.
70318:7	for some reason, because of the cold, uh, ocean, uh, water, the air is always cool.	###.###uh-huh.###.###and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid, more and more humid.###and here it's, uh, well it's right by the ocean,###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, it's not the same as corpus.###corpus, you get that humid salty feeling in the air.###.###uh-huh.###.###but here, um, well the water is extremely cold, up here,###you can lay on the beach all you want --n40588c,###but if you want --n40592e to go --n40593d wind suffering or diving or swimming, you have --n405968 to wear a wet suit. and a thick wet suit at that, because it's just extremely cold###.###uh-huh.###.###and i,
70357:25	and, they have, of course, some pretty severe storms, winter storms, snow and that type of thing.	###so it's a nice change.###so we'll be here a couple of years###and we thought well, we'll take advantage of it and see what all the pacific coast is like --n4062af.###.###that's nice.###.###so it's been good.###.###well, my wife's originally from virginia###and we lived there for about nine months###and that was a real change for me.###.###oh, i imagine.###virginia, i imagine --n40659c, gets real humid, doesn't it.###.###um, parts do.### we, we're over in the western edge in the mountains.###.###oh.###.
70401:19	maybe we can send you some.	###and it doesn't really hang around that long.###.###yeah.###.###so, they, the people i know --n407171 that --n40717c are from there, uh, they always miss it###and they want --n4072aa to go back.###nothing seems quite as good.###but, anyway. well,###.###well, as we were talking the weather came on###and there's a flash flood watch and, more rain for the next three or four days.###.###oh, gee-whiz.###.###.###oh, gosh.###well, i hope it moves up this way,###but i'm sure it won't.###.###yeah.
70612:21	living in the city has some advantages.	###this entire neighborhood, everybody keeps the places up real nice.###.###yeah.### that's, that's nice.###yeah,###the town that i came from --n13742 is, uh, is a, uh, older town,###it like,### the typical, the typical homes there are like, you know, early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds,###.###wow.###.###and i renovated a house there###and that was so much fun.###i mean, there, if you don't live in a house that --n13a60's at least seventy-five to hundred years old, you know, you're just nobody, practically.###and that was really, that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline###and, uh, mumblex was considered --n13d10 typical for that area.###so, uh, it --n13db1 was quite a change for me to come to a house like that --n13dec now that --n13dfb's just, you know, a very square little box###and, you know, there's not a whole lot you can do --n13f96 with it.###but, uh, anyway,###.
70670:14	i've got some onions --n15492 out, tomatoes,	###i really do enjoy that.###but i haven't planted anything yet###or, you know, i usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo,###but i, i haven't done that, yet.###i've had finals this week.###so, uh, you know, i'm just kind of trying to, trying --n1507d to stick in with that,###.###huh-uh.###.###but, uh, since that's over with now, maybe i can, i can get this yard in shape.###do you do a lot of gardening.###.###uh, landscaping is more, than the gardening,###.###yeah.###.###in the garden i've got my beans, peas,###.###yeah.###.
70703:18	well, i've done some rewiring on it.	###um, what do you do --n15b5c.###do you have any tips you could give me --n15bd7.###.###um, my favorite one is putting on the, um, tomato plant is to put, uh, mumblex dust,###.###yeah.###yeah.###.###and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time,###.###that's true.###that's true.###my dad is a farmer###so, i've heard him talk about that forever.###i guess it works,###but, um, you have --n16022 to really wash your vegetables after that###so it won't make you sick.### let's see###what else do you do --n1617c to your house.###.
70851:34	and, uh, so, we had --n4009e3 to make some adjustments	###.###well, at the my-,###i introduced you a little bit to it, a few minutes ago, when i said that we are, uh, we're on the east coast now --n4004ea.###.###uh-huh.###.###my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that,###well, we both decided we wanted --n4006d9 to move to north carolina.###.###uh-huh.###.###and so naturally we put ourselves,###we looked at our budget,###.###yeah.###.###and so, what we did --n400884 was draw up a budget that we thought, uh, --n4008bb was realistic.###.###uh-huh.###.
70974:78	so. but, um, that's the hardest part for us is that it's really, um, you know, budgeting and some extra things, you know, for-, that --n403eb1 are more, you know, nonessential items.	###.###uh-huh.###.###and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all,###but it seems like there's, um, times when we just have --n40314f to get out --n403162 where we'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow, you know, fifty, sixty dollars in one night going out --n4031e5 to eat, going to a show or doing something --n403214, you know.###.###well, i think that's important for your budget to be realis-,###for it to work though, you have --n403589 to do something.###.###yeah,###that's the hard part because when we sit down --n403663 to make it --n403676, we try --n403689 to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week###and then it's not really that realistic###because we do find that we want --n4038b6 to go and do something or splurge for, you know, birthday for somebody###or, you know, even we, we even do things real frugally for the kids,###we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age, you know, whether they're jordache new or whether they're, you know, something###.###of course not.###.###and they're both boys###so they just mumblex one year after the other in each other's clothes,
71046:43	well, uh, but i do realize that, that is realistic for some people,	###now, i forget which way we do it --n4051fa.###we don't list all the deductions###and then we get more money back, you know, at the end of the year,###.###oh, no,###no,###no,###no.###.###so, that's not a good way to,###.###you don't want the government to spend your money.###you want --n40555d to be able,###.###that's what my husband said --n4055db,###so this last year he changed it, of course,###we didn't get hardly and then nearly as much back###and it was like oh, no.### better find another way of saving money.###.
71160:78	i, i don't know what amount of, what amount of, our hardware --n402c70 would stop some fanatic, i guess, from --n402c9b doing anything, uh, that --n402cba would be irrational.	###uh,###on,###now i work for t i,###and one of the things we were told --n401f48 is, like, they had eleven thousand harm missiles which t i is the sole supplier for --n401f9b,###and they used up two thousand of them in, in the war,###so they're going --n40219e to have --n4021ad to do another contract --n4021c4 to restock that, to get ready in case something else is needed --n4021ff.###.###yeah,###but, it, it, it,###would that be, uh,###well, let's see,###two thousand out of eleven thousand, that's about a little over twenty per cent.###uh, i, i should imagine that, that would be to keep it at a level, those levels, i guess, that, that --n4025db were originally appropriated --n4025ee w-, was when the soviet threat, i guess, was perceived --n402635 as --n402640 being a greater one --n402657.###i don't think there's very much of a threat there today.###i do worry about what nuclear weapons --n4029d5 are left --n4029e4 in the territories, uh, in their territory over there, and who --n402a23's controlling them,###but,###.### tha-, that's true,###that's true.###.
71184:87	so tho-, those are two areas in which t i stands --n403554 to, to gain some, some short term business --n403593 to restock that --n4035a6.	###right.###.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, uh, uh, t i also makes the missile, which --n403028 was the, the t v laser guided bombs###.###yeah.###.### and, and, a big percentage of that was expended --n40316e, as well,### that n-, that w-, that was just a matter of,###.###oh, what --n40331f is the name of that.###.###uh, it's called --n4033b2 paveway.###.###yes,###yes.###.###and, uh, a big percentage of that was used --n40346f up during that conflict also.
71201:52	uh, i kn-, i'm familiar with some, some upbeat school areas,	###yes.###.###and, uh, a big percentage of that was used --n40346f up during that conflict also.###so tho-, those are two areas in which t i stands --n403554 to, to gain some, some short term business --n403593 to restock that --n4035a6.###.###yeah,###well, uh, i'm, what i'm, uh, i guess uh, it, concerned about --n40379a, talking about the taxes in general,###and that, that was an area that i, i perceive --n40392e as --n403939 not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed --n403978 for --n403983,###uh, in the area of defense,###or perhaps we have paid too much there,###i don't know,###it just seems to me that over the years, now, the,### and, and it's, it's a cliche,### i, i,###but i see it myself,###i see where the infrastructure --n403e58 is sort of breaking down, the roads, the highways --n403e8b.###.###oh, no doubt.###.### i, i, i don't know,
71222:34	to g-, to give you some perspective, this, this town that i had lived in --n404da9 for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded --n404dcc sixty-five per cent by state funds.	###so i don't totally agree with the, the great, uh, uh, with the, with the great ex-, expenditure of effort and time there,###but i guess overall, because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools, and, and, uh, and, uh, rural school systems are like --n4043c6, i, i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure.###.###yeah,###as a matter of fact, in texas, um, we've had our school funding system declared --n404645 unconstitutional by the, a state judge,###and they,###and, uh, the legislature just passed what they called --n4047bc a robin hood bill, which,###basically, what it does --n404896, is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts, that --n4048d9 are, that --n4048f0 are, you know come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state, that --n404947 are not so affluent.###.###uh-huh.###.###.### they, they don't have a broad based income tax that --n404baa funds the educational system,###.###uh,###well,###.###or is it all funded --n404cbf out of local taxes.###.###okay,
71262:123	uh, i, uh, i, i do, i, i guess i am a s-, uh, a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education.	###.###uh, do you mean a, a complete reversal.###because, i guess, they can't raise that money in those, those poorer districts,###huh.###.###oh, complete, complete.###it's all shifted to local districts,###and now, even the money that --n405926's been raised --n405939 for the local districts is being, is going --n405964 to be siphoned --n405977 off and sent --n40598a to other parts of the state.###.###.###that's right,### and, and i have, i have no problem, with, uh, a certain, uh, floor level, minimum level, that --n405bc7's a standard uh, that everybody, uh, ought --n405bfa to be able --n405c0d to have --n405c1c,###uh,###.###yeah.###.###but, i am opposed to, w-, any attempts to restrict, um, local communities from --n405e7f taxing themselves above that --n405e96 to provide above the minimum.###.###yes,###i see what you're saying --n406004.
71287:32	at least what i read --n40710d, is that some younger people feel that education is priced --n407140 out of their, uh, out of their, uh, budget.	###my masters, anyway.###.###what,###but, uh, when i look at it --n406685 to me, uh, it doesn't really make any difference.###it was a marvelous opportunity that i couldn't have done --n4067a3,###i don't think i would have gone on, unless i had that financial uh, easement made --n406879 possible.###.###yeah.###.###.###that's right.###.###and i, i don't really care what it takes --n4069e3 to qualify, whether you're, uh, an, an ex-, whether you're a veteran or whether you,###i don't even know if you have --n406c15 to perform community service,###or unless, uh, or, or you promise to even do something in the future, i think that, uh, the, that, that, the subsidy itself,###or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation, would give many people who,### i, i think, i think i perceive the fact,###.###uh-huh.###.
71321:4	some states they pay, uh,	###.###yeah,### they had --n40792d to, they had --n407944 to raise, uh, community college taxes here, a few years ago.###.###but that, uh, i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to, uh, was expending so much money --n407aef on defense, uh, that, that the program now is a, uh, program now is, uh,###fees that, that --n407d93 fund these things, i guess that's trickled down to the states###and, the states now establish, uh, don't have enough money###.###uh-huh.###.###so they, they must charge fees.###uh, i, i'm not too sure of that reasoning.###.###yeah.###.###but i guess to get back to the main topic, i don't know whether i pay too much taxes.### i, i, i travel extensively in europe and see enormous, uh,###people p-, pay, uh, a great deal in taxes,###they tell me###when i sit and talk to people there --n408409 they tell me they, they,
71322:37	in germany or in, in england in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay up to six-, fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes.	###yeah,### they had --n40792d to, they had --n407944 to raise, uh, community college taxes here, a few years ago.###.###but that, uh, i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to, uh, was expending so much money --n407aef on defense, uh, that, that the program now is a, uh, program now is, uh,###fees that, that --n407d93 fund these things, i guess that's trickled down to the states###and, the states now establish, uh, don't have enough money###.###uh-huh.###.###so they, they must charge fees.###uh, i, i'm not too sure of that reasoning.###.###yeah.###.###but i guess to get back to the main topic, i don't know whether i pay too much taxes.### i, i, i travel extensively in europe and see enormous, uh,###people p-, pay, uh, a great deal in taxes,###they tell me###when i sit and talk to people there --n408409 they tell me they, they,###some states they pay, uh,
71327:39	now it costs me money --n40896b to leave the country, some sort of a tax to leave the country, some sort of an airport departure tax, uh, uh, a tax, a sales tax which --n4089fa is getting to, uh, quite high levels,	###and, the states now establish, uh, don't have enough money###.###uh-huh.###.###so they, they must charge fees.###uh, i, i'm not too sure of that reasoning.###.###yeah.###.###but i guess to get back to the main topic, i don't know whether i pay too much taxes.### i, i, i travel extensively in europe and see enormous, uh,###people p-, pay, uh, a great deal in taxes,###they tell me###when i sit and talk to people there --n408409 they tell me they, they,###some states they pay, uh,###in germany or in, in england in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay up to six-, fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes.###.###oh, oh, i can believe that.###.### but, but, i'm not too sure when i put my property tax --n4087f7 in, my car tax, my income tax, and these myriad of, uh,
71327:67	now it costs me money --n40896b to leave the country, some sort of a tax to leave the country, some sort of an airport departure tax, uh, uh, a tax, a sales tax which --n4089fa is getting to, uh, quite high levels,	###and, the states now establish, uh, don't have enough money###.###uh-huh.###.###so they, they must charge fees.###uh, i, i'm not too sure of that reasoning.###.###yeah.###.###but i guess to get back to the main topic, i don't know whether i pay too much taxes.### i, i, i travel extensively in europe and see enormous, uh,###people p-, pay, uh, a great deal in taxes,###they tell me###when i sit and talk to people there --n408409 they tell me they, they,###some states they pay, uh,###in germany or in, in england in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay up to six-, fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes.###.###oh, oh, i can believe that.###.### but, but, i'm not too sure when i put my property tax --n4087f7 in, my car tax, my income tax, and these myriad of, uh,
71422:31	and i can still do some, some sorts of things	###and it's just one of the things i enjoy --n4005ab doing --n4005b6.###.###so do --n400668 i.###i would, i had rather be outside than, than inside any day.###.###so would --n4007a3 i.###.###do you work during the week, uh, outside the home.###.###yes,###i do.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, so i manage --n4008eb to fit in my gardening chores afterward,###i work for a school system###so i'm able --n4009e2 to do that, um, because i get home a little earlier,###.###yes.###.

72128:34	the, uh, the, some of the nautilus equipment that i started --n4067ed seeing --n4067f8 at the one that we used --n406817 to go to --n40682a was really interesting,	###oh, okay,### not in the, not in the, aerobic instructor type field.###.###oh.###.###.###no,###no,###no,###no,###oh, i could never do that i don't think,.###.###.###i'd rather just be the student,.###and, uh, occasionally i do the weights --n4066bd at the health club but low weights just...###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,
72160:27	just to do, you know, some bicep, tricep exercises.	###right.###well, they, um, i just noticed at our health club they will put on these computerized one, these computerized machines,###and you set a speed --n406ffa on it and the weight### and it, and it makes you do it.###and it tells you###like if you're going too slow it will say, my grandmother could do this faster than you. and stuff like, a turtle goes faster###.###.###and, um, it tells it###and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you --n407354.###.###a little negative reinforcement there while you're going.###.###yeah.###so, uh, do that, stuff like that###but just i've never used those machines###i just use the regular machines and the free weights, you know, like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights.###.###yeah.###.
72387:13	and i see some of the problems the kids have --n403695 when they don't have a real good family structure --n4036c4.	### when, when your wife has her baby --n402f2a, is she going --n402f41 to stay home###or is she going --n40301e to, go back to work.###.###yeah,### we're, we're going --n4030d9 to try and have her stay home, for as long as possible.###.###.###what do you think --n403212.###.### that, that, that,### i would, i would like --n40330b to be able --n40331e to do that.###.###yeah,###we think it's, uh, that important###and i, i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction.###i'm a, a counselor and a therapist,###.###uh-huh.###.###and i work with adolescents,
72419:19	so. if there was some way for, for women to, to stay home even if they could work --n404691, you know,	###.###i think morally, um, it seems like there was, peo-, people were a lot better back then as far as hig-, higher standards.###.###true.###well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure###and with women working so much they're kind of pulled --n40413d out of it too.###.###yeah.###.###so, kids are raised --n404219 around their friends and by the media.###.###yeah,###that's true.###.###and that's, you know, that's contributed --n404328,###.###and i think, i think you're going --n4043ee to see a lot more of that in the future.###.###yeah,###maybe that's contributed --n40453e to a lot of the problems that we see --n404569 all the time,
72420:95	there are a lot of jobs that --n4047f6 are coming about, like in computers at home, and those types of things, that --n404841 would at least in some ways, um, bridge the gap.	###i think morally, um, it seems like there was, peo-, people were a lot better back then as far as hig-, higher standards.###.###true.###well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure###and with women working so much they're kind of pulled --n40413d out of it too.###.###yeah.###.###so, kids are raised --n404219 around their friends and by the media.###.###yeah,###that's true.###.###and that's, you know, that's contributed --n404328,###.###and i think, i think you're going --n4043ee to see a lot more of that in the future.###.###yeah,###maybe that's contributed --n40453e to a lot of the problems that we see --n404569 all the time,###so. if there was some way for, for women to, to stay home even if they could work --n404691, you know,
72488:43	but we may have --n406888 to give up on some, some things.	###yeah.###.###so. it's not, not a real functional situation anyway.###so, you know, i don't know it's, i don't know that that trend's going --n405e24 to change the single parent type families###and the mumblex families, as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society.###.###yeah,### i, i think that eventually the, the family unit's just not going --n4060bf to even exist anymore.###mumblex like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think there's going --n406215 to be more single parent families than there are, um, you know, two parent families.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's pretty sad.###.###yeah,###it is,###i guess unless, unless there's a, a major swing in the change of what --n4064b7's important to people, you know, probably keep going downhill.###and i, i don't know### we, we feel like that, that we can make it on one income### it, it may be tough
72554:39	i wish i had in, in some senses	###.###and, uh, i also like romantic novels.### i like, uh, i like readers digest, believe it or not.###.###yeah,###so do --n400546 i.###.###i usually read that from cover to cover.###.###yeah.###.###i like it because there's a little bit of everything in it.###.###right.###.###you know, that kind of a thing.###uh, as far as like real novels, i haven't gotten into shakespeare or any of that type of thing.###.###uh-huh.###.
72563:7	for some reason it seems --n400ca8 to interest me, like people that --n400ccb make a big comeback or, you know, orel hershiser, things like that.	###yeah.###.###i like it because there's a little bit of everything in it.###.###right.###.###you know, that kind of a thing.###uh, as far as like real novels, i haven't gotten into shakespeare or any of that type of thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###i wish i had in, in some senses###but i don't have time --n400975 really as much as i would like to, to get into that kind of thing.###how about you.###.###um, well, i like, like you said, real life, um,###i like biographies of people's lives, like, especially like athletes,###.###uh-huh.###.
72579:15	but they usually have some good articles in it.	###i like biographies of people's lives, like, especially like athletes,###.###uh-huh.###.###for some reason it seems --n400ca8 to interest me, like people that --n400ccb make a big comeback or, you know, orel hershiser, things like that.###.###sure.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, i like --n400e66 to read books on improve, like family, marriage, you know, things that --n400ead are written --n400ebc by like christian authors or, um, doctors about family and, you know, how to improve your home --n400f1b and all that kind of thing.###um, i like --n401143 to re-,###the magazines i###to rel-,###i like --n40122b to read###mumblex,###i read a lot of bicycling magazines.###they're,###i mainly look at the pictures and stuff,
72763:7	and some of the people, uh,	###.###and, um, i, i like --n40498c to, uh, read about people who --n4049b7 have been a successful, you know, who, who --n4049ee made a success of their lives.###.###yeah.###.###.### which, what book --n404be3 --n404bea have you read --n404bfd that --n404c08 is along those lines, that --n404c27 was really good.###.###uh, to, to give you specific titles### i, i can't.###.###.###well, how about who,###.###like i say, haven't done it in, in such a long time.###.###do you know who it was about --n404f9e.###.###um, well, i went to, uh, seminar on, uh,###it was for, by american business
72832:14	there may be some schools you could read about --n4067dc and learn.	###.###you're more fun though, see.###you're not ridged right.###.###yeah,###right### i, i,###that's###see, i like it that way though.### i, i, i would, i don't want --n4063e6 to change that part of me.###.###that's good.###.###that's funny,### e-, even though i admire someone who --n4065b1 isn't, like i am, you know, and, and i wish i could be more that way###.###yeah.###.###but,###.
73034:47	because my sister worked at the, uh, the visa some bank americard center there.	###.###a lot of people that --n4091f4 work for me that --n40920b can't even spell or read, you know.###.###exactly,###and i think that that's why reading is so important --n40934f,###.###yeah.###.###because, uh, i think even mentally when you can do some,###.###.###i don't,### guess we got our first, uh, credit card, oh, back in the seventies, early seventies when, i first got married --n4000b6###.###uh-huh.###.### was a visa card. uh, issued out of a liberty bank in oklahoma city,###.###uh-huh###.
73120:9	and for some strange reason those people think they need --n401d77 to get paid --n401d8a.	###we took a loan and paid them all off.### we keep them, uh, we keep, uh, one gas card and, uh, and, uh, visa just, you know, in case there's an emergency or, something###.###right.###.###but other than that we don't use them anymore.###.###well, that's kind of the way we were doing###it's, uh,###.###uh-huh.###.###i guess for that very reason that, that, uh, if you're not real conscious of what you're doing --n401a86, it's just too much by the time you get,###.###uh-huh.###.###well, if you got a bunch of cards, you get a bunch of bills every month###.###uh-huh.###.
73140:10	and then some of them add late fees on it, if they don't get paid --n4021d5	###and for some strange reason those people think they need --n401d77 to get paid --n401d8a.###.###i know,###isn't that funny.###.###yeah.###.###.###and i give them,### maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about --n401f17 getting paid###because they're,### know if you don't, then they're adding on, what, eighteen, nineteen, twenty percent.###.###.###sometimes, it's twenty-two percent interest.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,
73173:67	so, they've got quite a bit more motivation i think --n40282f to get paid --n402846 then, some of the others do.	###there's no,###.###huh.###.###with the american express card from t i, there's no, um, late fee,###.###uh-huh.###.###there's no, uh, interest rate,###.###oh, really.###.### you ei-, you either pay the thing off###or they come --n4026eb get it.###.###.###and it's turned into personnel###and they come --n4027a3 get you.###.###.
73222:66	i've got three card offers --n403598 now, uh, from gas companies and, uh, visa gold and, uh, some,, other bank, uh,	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###you're not the only one.###.###yeah.###.###so, yo-, uh, you want --n40318a to make sure that, uh,###is that okay, is that o-, okay, that those people see what it is that you are buying --n4032b0,###.###yeah.###.###and most of the time it is.###.###.###but, most of the others i've sent back##, i mean, all you get --n4034e2 is card offers,
73491:25	and, uh, when i seen some of my friends that --n403992 have taken that six week old baby, you know, to someone else --n4039d1, it's just, i can imagine how emotional it must be --n403a0c.	###sure.###sure.###.###there are those times when i think, gee, if i didn't have children i could be out --n402e81 playing bridge or golf --n402e98.###.###right.###right.###right.###right.###but, you know, it's funny.### i did, i had a friend that --n403099 said, you know, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other###and she got older###and she said, but you know, we never do those things anyway.###so why, why am i waiting, you know --n4033f1,### it's, it's just the way your attitude changes --n4034b9###and you mature i suppose --n403580.###but the thing about the child care i, you know, i have friends that --n403619 struggle financially### and, and they both do have --n403719 to work.###it's a matter --n4037c0 not necessarily, uh, that she --n4037e3 might want --n4037f2 to stay home or he, as well,###but, you know, they need the money.
73538:38	i think that might be part of the problem with some people. you know,	###huh-uh.###.###they are not all things to all people or all children.###.###right.###.###.###right.###right.###yeah.###.###the ones that --n404473 are good with babies tend --n40448e not to be good with toddlers.###.###huh-uh.###.###.###huh-uh.###i think it takes a,###i don't know,###i think your patient level must, needs --n404660 to increase as the child gets older.
73755:84	people are being a little more, oh, i don't know, a little le-, a little less bigoted in some ways,	###.###.###huh-uh.###.###.###okay,###so, um, how do think, how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years --n40008c.###.###uh, i'm at a little bit of a loss,###you know, i don't know,###ten years ago,###see i'm what, i'm about, uh, twenty-eight now###so when i was eighteen --n400392,###.###uh-huh.###.###things haven't changed a whole lot.###.###really.###.
73903:6	at some point	###.###yeah.###.###so. yeah,### that's, that's a good point###so, i'm trying --n4028d7 to think of anything else that --n4028f6's changed over the last ten or twenty years.###.###yeah,###for me it's kind of hard,###i don't know.###i think,###i don't know,###i think the middle class is shrinking and the, uh, lower class is expanding###.###oh, yeah,###i agree.###.###and sooner or later there's going --n402c6e to, there's going --n402c89 to be a turn around.###.###well, i hope so, you know,
74032:16	well, i got some friends that, uh,	###i guess if this is the only place you've lived --n404657, lubbock is a lot different than dallas.###.###yeah,###flat, dry and dirty,###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###but the people all seem --n4047fb to be a lot more laid back, too,###i mean, here in dallas everything is just real rush, rush.###.###yeah,###i lived in the country for several years,###and living in the city is a whole different uh, social structure###.###oh yeah.###.###but, uh,###.
74155:5	some of these are urban worries	###.###yeah,###i think that's right.###.### i can see, i can see the, uh, you know,###.### i, i can remember as a child, you know, nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted --n400e85 to go --n400e94.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.### it wasn't, it --n401046 didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me###they were,###.###and you, you didn't, you didn't have --n4011d5 to lock your door.###.###no,###no.###.###and, uh, a lo-,
74169:16	we've been having some problem now	###and you, you didn't, you didn't have --n4011d5 to lock your door.###.###no,###no.###.###and, uh, a lo-,###some of these are urban worries###but, uh, it's, uh, it's a lot different all though i guess twenty years a go now, in this area, things were, um, similar because twenty years ago### let's see,###it was after,###.###it's not all that long ago is it.###.###yeah,###to twenty, twenty-five years ago is when we had the washington riots --n4016fa,###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###the first rights
74234:44	i think the other thing is that, uh, we have taken some rather drastic turns in our, in our education and the way we approach things --n402975 as of maybe starting back when, when i'm number one, you know, and, uh, uh, uh, worrying about self and not, uh, seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family --n402a24.	###yeah,###but, you know, it's, it is interesting,###uh, they're so many mor-,###they're different kind of dangers --n402399 that --n4023a4 face young people now and social pressures,###uh, the pressures of drug is so much,###the prevalence is so much greater,###.###uh-huh.###.### the, the kinds of diseases that you've got --n402589 out the, uh, um,###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean the consequences is###so much of what --n4026fa's going on, is so much more serious then when we were younger --n402739.###.###i think that's true,###i think that's true.###.###.
74244:20	if you don't have some kind of, of basic believe or something down inside of you, then it --n4030a3's very difficult to, uh, have anything to turn to --n4030e6, when you got, when you've got something facing you like that --n403125.	###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean the consequences is###so much of what --n4026fa's going on, is so much more serious then when we were younger --n402739.###.###i think that's true,###i think that's true.###.###.###i think the other thing is that, uh, we have taken some rather drastic turns in our, in our education and the way we approach things --n402975 as of maybe starting back when, when i'm number one, you know, and, uh, uh, uh, worrying about self and not, uh, seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family --n402a24.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.### and, uh, and there have been many things that --n402d53 have happened that --n402d66 have not encouraged closeness of families and, uh, support for young people that the kind of support that they need --n402dc5, --n402dd0 to help them take care of the things,###.###yes,###and,###.
74301:11	i see some flickers of, of, uh, of good directions turning,	###.###no.###.###.###that's right.###.###.###oh.###.###and you're, you get mixed signals###so it's, it's not always the school's systems###i think a lot of, it is the families, the way you were mentioning --n403da5,###.###no,###there's so much more, then that###it starts, --n403f0d very much deeper then that###.###yeah.###.###i think that too.
74324:8	and, some people just don't have it.	###.###but whether they're soon enough and fast enough i don't know --n40413f,###it's just,###.###of course, life is a lot more complicated too in ways,###um, the kinds of jobs that people need --n4042c7 to be trained, for --n4042e6 now.###.###right.###.###uh, you know, with farming being so mechanized, uh, people working on the family farm which --n40441d was a traditional american way that becomes less and less likely,###.###uh-huh.###.###factory jobs are so much more, um, uh, sophisticated.###.###yeah,###that's right.###.###and the kinds of knowledge that, uh, you know,### it, it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force
74341:4	some ways it's rather frightening,	###.###and the kinds of knowledge that, uh, you know,### it, it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force###and, some people just don't have it.###.###right.###.###.###and there's so much, so, so many people on the lower end of those who, who --n404899 are going --n4048a8 to be the, the drop outs and the, and the poor and the homeless and whatnot,###.###and you worry when, you know these the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children,###.###.###yeah,###that's just another,###.###uh, in terms of what it's going --n404ca0 to mean --n404caf to a society, in the future it's a###.###yeah.###.
74537:12	so i have some rather strong opinions.	###bye-bye.###.###.###well, kathleen, do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system.###.###i certainly do.###uh, i think... i think we have a lousy school system.###.###and what do you think that problem is --n40021a.###.###and i think a lot of it has --n4002ac to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well.###and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents.###and then, oh, we don't, uh, we put too much, uh, responsibility --n400502 on the teachers, for things that --n400525 are really not education.###.###.###they're social services.###.###huh. that seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before.###.###well, i, as a matter of fact, i just finished --n400798 editing a book on the topic.
74560:83	and then i would provide, uh, use the money that we've paying them --n401062 --n401069 to, uh, provide some special help in training and particularly, uh, mentor teachers --n4010b8 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who --n4010e7 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time.	###do you, uh, yourself...###.### and, and i'm sure they're colored --n4009a4 by what i've edited --n4009bf.###.###do youself have children wi-, who --n400aaf are --n400aba or have been --n400acd through the public school system.###.###yes,###i do.###and i was not very happy with the results.###.###i see.###so if you were --n400caf to improve it, what would you do --n400cd6 --n400cdd to improve it.###.###well, i think i would start with a --bout, with --n400ddf getting rid --n400dee of about two-thirds of the administrators. and all the auxiliary personnel. the school bureaucracy that --n400e39 exists --n400e44 mainly to perpetuate itself.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.
74568:22	and then let them try some innovative things and see what --n401411 works. and then, uh, have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who --n401470 could benefit from the same sorts of things. and then from the parents' side, have the parents support the school. get involved.	###and i was not very happy with the results.###.###i see.###so if you were --n400caf to improve it, what would you do --n400cd6 --n400cdd to improve it.###.###well, i think i would start with a --bout, with --n400ddf getting rid --n400dee of about two-thirds of the administrators. and all the auxiliary personnel. the school bureaucracy that --n400e39 exists --n400e44 mainly to perpetuate itself.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###and then i would provide, uh, use the money that we've paying them --n401062 --n401069 to, uh, provide some special help in training and particularly, uh, mentor teachers --n4010b8 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who --n4010e7 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###sure.###sure.###.
74568:63	and then let them try some innovative things and see what --n401411 works. and then, uh, have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who --n401470 could benefit from the same sorts of things. and then from the parents' side, have the parents support the school. get involved.	###and i was not very happy with the results.###.###i see.###so if you were --n400caf to improve it, what would you do --n400cd6 --n400cdd to improve it.###.###well, i think i would start with a --bout, with --n400ddf getting rid --n400dee of about two-thirds of the administrators. and all the auxiliary personnel. the school bureaucracy that --n400e39 exists --n400e44 mainly to perpetuate itself.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###and then i would provide, uh, use the money that we've paying them --n401062 --n401069 to, uh, provide some special help in training and particularly, uh, mentor teachers --n4010b8 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who --n4010e7 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###sure.###sure.###.
74580:17	that's, uh, some pretty good ideas.	###and then i would provide, uh, use the money that we've paying them --n401062 --n401069 to, uh, provide some special help in training and particularly, uh, mentor teachers --n4010b8 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who --n4010e7 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###sure.###sure.###.###and then let them try some innovative things and see what --n401411 works. and then, uh, have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who --n401470 could benefit from the same sorts of things. and then from the parents' side, have the parents support the school. get involved.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.### pay attention to what --n401738's happening. talk to the teachers. uh, talk to their kids about school. and support the institution###and, a-,###instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the, uh, the teacher's in the middle.###.###uh-huh.
74608:91	but, uh, that was, that's the extent of which i guess that's more than, than some people, less than others.	###oh, well. that i'm not so sure about --n401dbd.###i've got a lot of things --n401e4b to keep me busy.###.###uh-huh.###that...###.###have you done anything like that.###anything political.###.###well, my mother was on the school board. as we were coming up.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, that, basically, is the extent to which our, our family has been directly, you know,###they've always been involved.###my parents through the, the p t a organization.###and my mother was on the school board for eight years.###.###uh-huh.###.
74636:26	so we'd have --n40333c to have some way to, uh, reward and recognize the teachers who --n403383 are doing a good job and give them a, a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money --n4033e6.	###uh-huh.###.###and if there was a way to, through the public mind, set that image to be a little higher esteem, a little, uh, uh, a little more prestige to being a teacher --n402998.###and with that, of course, you know, you have --n402b78 to pay them a, accordingly.###if we paid them more, it would attract more the, the higher educated people to, to either move into that field or to continue in that field.###.###yeah.###.###and then if you paid them more, you'd also be able --n402e81 to demand a higher quality product out of them.###.###i think that's absolutely right.###they,###the thing that --n403020 worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board, you're going --n40306f to be, uh, rewarding people who --n403096've been doing a lousy job. and instead of getting the, uh, improvement that we want --n4030e9.###.###.###sure.###.###.###sure.###.
74636:127	so we'd have --n40333c to have some way to, uh, reward and recognize the teachers who --n403383 are doing a good job and give them a, a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money --n4033e6.	###uh-huh.###.###and if there was a way to, through the public mind, set that image to be a little higher esteem, a little, uh, uh, a little more prestige to being a teacher --n402998.###and with that, of course, you know, you have --n402b78 to pay them a, accordingly.###if we paid them more, it would attract more the, the higher educated people to, to either move into that field or to continue in that field.###.###yeah.###.###and then if you paid them more, you'd also be able --n402e81 to demand a higher quality product out of them.###.###i think that's absolutely right.###they,###the thing that --n403020 worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board, you're going --n40306f to be, uh, rewarding people who --n403096've been doing a lousy job. and instead of getting the, uh, improvement that we want --n4030e9.###.###.###sure.###.###.###sure.###.
74649:24	you know, if there's some gauge that they could make --n403b5c.	###.###.###sure.###.###.###sure.###.###so we'd have --n40333c to have some way to, uh, reward and recognize the teachers who --n403383 are doing a good job and give them a, a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money --n4033e6.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.### it, unfortunately, it's a, and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones --n40361d###.###uh-huh.###yeah.### it's, it --n40378b's hard to tell.###.###so it's very, it --n403860's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one, other than i guess how, you kn-, how a person scores --n4038eb in the beginning before the class and then after the class.
74656:7	but some certain type of, of position where you're overseen --n403f52 --n403f59 to begin with.	###so we'd have --n40333c to have some way to, uh, reward and recognize the teachers who --n403383 are doing a good job and give them a, a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money --n4033e6.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.### it, unfortunately, it's a, and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones --n40361d###.###uh-huh.###yeah.### it's, it --n40378b's hard to tell.###.###so it's very, it --n403860's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one, other than i guess how, you kn-, how a person scores --n4038eb in the beginning before the class and then after the class.###you know, if there's some gauge that they could make --n403b5c.###.###yeah.###.###uh, also, i've alw-, i've thought around about the idea of making teaching and the,###before you can get a certificate, you have a, a certain residency period. so much like a doctor.###maybe not the four years definitely.
74670:51	at least what i used --n40441a to observe --n404429 in student teaching, was that some college kid who --n404458 might not be all that bright to begin with, was thrown --n404493 into a class room with a teacher who --n4044ba was harried and overworked and, uh, had too many kids to handle --n404501 and too many things to do --n404528 and too many interruptions to pay much attention to the student teacher.	###.###yeah.###.###uh, also, i've alw-, i've thought around about the idea of making teaching and the,###before you can get a certificate, you have a, a certain residency period. so much like a doctor.###maybe not the four years definitely.###but some certain type of, of position where you're overseen --n403f52 --n403f59 to begin with.###.###yeah.###now that's a very good suggestion.###.###uh, just something --n4040dc to, i-,###rather than throw someone in, into that environment, uh, you know, it###.###yeah.### i don't think student, i don't think student teaching is enough.###.###i thought that maybe something.###.###i think that,
74713:56	well, another thing i think --n4058cf would be helpful would be to have some sort of, of say a national curriculum. because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for, uh, curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that --n40599a will sell in texas and california.	###and then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance.###.###sure.###sure.###that's good as a, a, a teaching aid.###but more you see these commercials that --n4051c2 have jimmy walking into class late###and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who --n40529c is in new york while jimmy's in rome.###.###huh.###.###and, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea.###.###.###i don't know if i i'm in favor yeah, in favor of, yeah,###.###i don't think that's going --n40555a to work.###.###i think, especially in the younger years you need --n405611 to have more of the, the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed --n405670 information to, to learn how to learn --n4056a3 --n4056aa.###.###yeah.
74757:171	and i hope maybe we're going --n406a0c to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid --n406a3b to it with, uh, reagan's, uh, new education secretary and, uh, you know, trying to do some, uh, trying --n406ac6 to produce some new programs anyway.	###and, you know, a third of the texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks.###.###sure.###sure.###.###and then the states that --n406515 either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids, just have --n406568 to follow along and take what texas gets --n40658f.###.###right.###.###mumblex california is the biggest for elementary schools###but texas, uh, adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade.###.###i see.###well, definitely is a national problem if, that they need --n406861 to address --n406870.###.###yep.### sure is.###.### definitely is.###.
74797:57	i measured it one time, because i was, uh, we had saw some termites	###sorry.###.###wow,###that's okay###so, tell me about your home.###.###oh, it's, uh, it looks like a little shot gun house, almost.###it's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other.###.###uh-huh.###.###it's, uh, an older home,###it's not new,###i like it though,###it's big.###.###oh really,###what kind of square footage.###.###oh, i wouldn't know,
74960:32	it's, it's seen some wear and tear. you know.	###uh-huh.###.###i'd hate --n402808 to clean these windows,###i really would.###.###i figured i'm going --n4028d9 to have --n4028e8 to hire somebody --n4028ff to remove our windows and put new ones --n402926 in that --n402935 are easier to clean --n402954.###ours are the double pane###and you can't really clean them on the inside, you know.###.###ours are those too,###yeah.###you must live in an older home too then.###.###right,###i do,###the house is about, um, i'd say --n402d13 almost thirty years old.###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's not a new home,
75025:28	i mean we need --n404106 to redo some, rewiring ourselves	###.###right,###there's one big one that --n403a7c has come off###and short of --n403b07 putting nails through it, we can't get it back on,###so.###.###um.###.###and he rewired the house###and it's shorting out here and there,###and###.###oh, wow,###i,###that's one of the things we've been fortunate with --n403d50, is our, uh, wiring is okay.### we don't have a, we don't have enough power,###um, or our breakers aren't, aren't powerful enough to take, to, to really help with the load in the house.###.###uh-huh.###.
75205:20	the fire alarm went off for some reason.	###and the light would come on###and the whole thing would be full of water.###and i mean the light would still come on.###it didn't blow up or anything.###.### my neighbor, or a friend of mine when i lived in louisiana --n407488, her,###we all lived on base,###my husband was in the army.###.###uh-huh.###.###she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning, water dripping from hers.###the neighbor's la-, uh, washing machine had uh, over done something,###i don't know###but it was leaking, just pouring water in###and it all went through to her roof###and it was coming out of the lights, fixtures.###.###oh.###.
75275:41	it's, it's been done for quite some time.	###i mean we'd done everything we could --n4086af --n4086b6 to keep out the weather. you know, and stuff###.###that's right.###that's right.###.###and,###.###well you got --n408880 to redo it the way you wanted it --n4088ab in the end.###.###oh yeah###it,###.###are you finished with it now.###.###uh, the roof.###.###uh-huh.###.###oh yeah,###yeah,
75552:115	it's kind of scary when i think of what --n405470 will happen in twenty years, you know, when i have kids and they're grown --n4054bb and, uh, just kind of some of the changes that --n4054f2 will happen even more --n405509	###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###in my day, we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected --n404f86 might be, sleeping with their boyfriends.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###but, they certainly didn't expect everybody to###and it was really only, uh, acceptable if you were engaged and planning --n405180 to get married --n405193 in, in the relatively near future.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i certainly know from --n4052f3 talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays.###.###oh, yeah.
75571:7	and some of the other ones weren't born.	###oh, yeah.###it's kind of scary when i think of what --n405470 will happen in twenty years, you know, when i have kids and they're grown --n4054bb and, uh, just kind of some of the changes that --n4054f2 will happen even more --n405509###so.###.###and i guess the answer, is, is, stay flexible because nobody can predict what --n405745's going --n405754 to happen in twenty years.###.### seems like it can't get much worse.###.###.###yeah.###.###i certainly wouldn't have been able --n405957 to twenty years ago tell you what, uh, my kids were likely --n405996 to be like --n4059a9.###course, one of them was just a, a, a brand new baby twenty years ago,###so i sure wouldn't have been able --n405bfd to predict for him.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###um.###.
75697:24	and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms uh, and including the out, uh, the outer perimeter type, uh, devices, sensors and things like that.	###but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country.###.###um.###.###our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies###and very few instances of, you know, alcohol, drugs, uh, reported.###.###uh-huh.###.###however, i'm sure they're there.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, right now our neighborhood is running about, uh, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed --n4017c2, sometime during their, their, uh, existence in that neighborhood.###.###wow.###.###.###that's huge.###.
75949:43	you can, you know, you can get some of us,	###.###uh, we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually, you know, shot the people --n406796###.###oh, my god.###.###and, uh, return offenders have,###they've actually waited for them, where they've robbed, you know, particular neighborhood --n406954,###they'll rob one house,###then other people will wait up, you know, and wait for somebody to do something else, try --n406aae to take it in their own hands.###.###right.###.###course it doesn't always work out in their favor.###.###right.###.###but, uh, nevertheless, i think people are just getting fed up and saying, you know, you can't arrest all of us,###.###uh-huh.###.
76160:21	and so, i think some of the things that i did --n40327b paid off.	###i, in, in,###i spent almost three years --n402ed2 redoing.###.###oh, yeah.###.###and i considered it a full time job###.###oh, it is,###yeah.###.###and when we did, uh,###we kind of had planned this, uh, trek to the east, because we're both originally from this part of the country.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###.###i see,###uh-huh.###.
76200:18	they, uh, auctioned some tools and, things like that,	###.###uh-huh.###.###and uh, all the men started --n403808 going down to the barn.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###uh, oh.###.###and so i, th-,###well shoot i'm going,###.###that's where i need --n4039b3 to go --n4039c2.###.###yes,###i'm going to the barn, too.###.###exactly.###.
76211:56	and, so, well, i thought, gee, i've been wanting --n403cea to, do some brick, uh, walkways for a time.	###well shoot i'm going,###.###that's where i need --n4039b3 to go --n4039c2.###.###yes,###i'm going to the barn, too.###.###exactly.###.###they, uh, auctioned some tools and, things like that,###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###but then they went over and started, uh, --n403bdb auctioning this big stack of bricks.###.###oh.###.
76223:21	anyway, it ended up after some pretty, uh, heavy bidding, that i got all those bricks for forty dollars.	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###but then they went over and started, uh, --n403bdb auctioning this big stack of bricks.###.###oh.###.###and, so, well, i thought, gee, i've been wanting --n403cea to, do some brick, uh, walkways for a time.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###work,###right,###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
76313:30	i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something un-, on, on top of the sand and then lay the bricks.	###yes.###well, it nearly killed me.###.###yeah,### but, but you did stag-, stagger back and say, oh, doesn't this look nice.###.###i hated --n404cbc to leave it.###.###well, let me ask you,###when you laid those bricks --n404da0,###i know my parents bought a house about ten years ago,###they're fixing --n404ea3 to sell it again, but, and move again.###they're kind of,###my mom's like i am.###she's a renovator, a lover of old things###.###uh-huh.###.###and, you know, they have --n4050e3 to be doing something constantly.###and the patio that --n405196 came with that house, uh, was not laid --n4051c5 on a, like,
76326:14	i did get some material and studied every bit of material that i could study --n405976,	###my mom's like i am.###she's a renovator, a lover of old things###.###uh-huh.###.###and, you know, they have --n4050e3 to be doing something constantly.###and the patio that --n405196 came with that house, uh, was not laid --n4051c5 on a, like,###i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something un-, on, on top of the sand and then lay the bricks.###.###no###we,###.###but they have, they have a problem with these little tin-, like sand bugs or something that --n4054e7 drill in between all these bricks.###.###well, i,###.###and, of course you know you have the, uh, the weeds that --n4056a7 come up in between the bricks or, and things like that.###.###well, no,### i, i didn't have that trouble because, uh, we laid the,
76377:36	if they have problems with, uh, sand bugs of some kind i think --n40684b all they need --n406862 to do --n406871 is probably --n406880 put some insecticide down in there on a, oh, a fairly regular basis, for a while anyway.	###.###but, uh, they just, they just haven't brought themselves to do it.###.###yeah,###well,###.###so,###.###and i also used a rubber hammer, a lot, --n40650a to, uh, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###if it wasn't quite level or something, i'd just get that, rubber hammer and, uh, and, and prob-, you know,###.###right.###.###i think that they could,
76377:93	if they have problems with, uh, sand bugs of some kind i think --n40684b all they need --n406862 to do --n406871 is probably --n406880 put some insecticide down in there on a, oh, a fairly regular basis, for a while anyway.	###.###but, uh, they just, they just haven't brought themselves to do it.###.###yeah,###well,###.###so,###.###and i also used a rubber hammer, a lot, --n40650a to, uh, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###if it wasn't quite level or something, i'd just get that, rubber hammer and, uh, and, and prob-, you know,###.###right.###.###i think that they could,
76519:22	if, uh, you've some kid who --n40072c doesn't have, uh, who --n40074f's from a broken family, the schools are supposed --n40077e to fill that void.	###so, as far as looking toward the future, you know, that's my plan.###i'm going --n409320 to have --n40932f to move fast, i think, though, because, uh, you know, as a,###.###.###do you have any particular thoughts about the school system.###.###well, um, i, i think that in, in, uh,###recently with the,###i'm not sure if it's more a problem with american families or a problem with the school system.###they seem --n4002dd to be burdening the school system more and more with problems, any problems that a child might have --n400330, whether it's actually a school related thing or not###and, i.###.###.###i say agree with you a hundred percent there.###.###yeah,### and, and, well, it's gotten --n4005a2 to a point where the schools are expected --n4005c9 to take care of everything --n4005e4.###.###yeah.###.
76613:41	and, uh, there really needs --n4031f1 to be a bridge, some sort of transition for that.	###.###right.###.###and so, they get put --n402b24 in, in, in our school system, in a class that --n402b77's limited --n402b86 for skills children that --n402b9d have, really have to master skills.###.###uh-huh.###.###and that's not their problem.###um, at the same time, i've seen,### we, we have a, an international population.###there's no bridge area for students coming out of the e s o l, which --n402f60 is english for speakers of other languages program.###.###uh-huh.###.###the,###once they're past e s o l, they get out,###they got thrown right into the total mainstream###.###right.###.
76785:27	i mean, you know, at some point a parent does help their kid, but in, in some ways,	###.###right.###.###i've been fortunate.###i have, uh, a son who --n406d24's a sophomore in college up in massachusetts at, uh, amherst,###.###uh-huh.###.###and my other son is a senior in high school,###and he's going on to williams.###and i mean, they're really super.###they're both national level swimmers,###.###sure.###.###and where we've been very fortunate,###but, you know, they had --n4070ae to be held --n4070c1 accountable too.###.###right.###.
76785:80	i mean, you know, at some point a parent does help their kid, but in, in some ways,	###.###right.###.###i've been fortunate.###i have, uh, a son who --n406d24's a sophomore in college up in massachusetts at, uh, amherst,###.###uh-huh.###.###and my other son is a senior in high school,###and he's going on to williams.###and i mean, they're really super.###they're both national level swimmers,###.###sure.###.###and where we've been very fortunate,###but, you know, they had --n4070ae to be held --n4070c1 accountable too.###.###right.###.
76809:59	it --n407a14's amazing how the, you know, people you talk to --n407a4f have some interesting conversations --n407a66	###.###and i think this is where the school system at, is suffering, and not through any fault of the effort of the school system --n407474.###.###right.###.###but gee it --n4075b3 was good talking with you.###.###it --n407649 was good talking to you too.###.###yeah,###so there are people throughout the country that --n407716 feel the same ways that you do --n407739, and, and are connected --n407758 with the schools.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###i've had interesting conversations on several subjects not, uh, not just this but different, the different things.###.###uh-huh.###.
77035:14	but, uh, some of,	###yeah.###well, i haven't talked to her.### i haven't, i haven't talked to a tina yet.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###w-,###uh, the, the call was probably for her.###they wouldn't accept my, uh, t i n number,###so we put hers in.###but, uh, uh, like i said, we're getting, getting the kids ready --n402afe to go to the birthday party,###.###yeah.###.###so.###.###yeah.###.
77264:6	and some people said to me," well, that's our wintertime."	###.###it,###.###the moss grows, on the trees in the woods up mumblex, eight, ten, feet.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###.###yeah.###that's the way it is, was, --n405faf there, too.###.###yeah.###i think, however, that's like february.###uh, i know it did it all february.
77309:26	what do you think --n400040 are some current trends in, uh, the way families spend time together --n400083, based on what you've seen --n4000a6.	###mumblex,###.###.###yeah.###well, i hope, i live through it.###.###yeah.###i do, too.###.###.###that's what i hope --n406838.###okay.###thanks a lot.###.###bye-bye.###.###good-bye.###.###.###okay,
77358:19	and, um, did some shopping and stuff.	###.###you know, if you have hobbies that --n400bd6 are the same, then, you know, you can enjoy your hobby together,###but my husband and i have different hobbies.###.###is he a hunter and a fisher and all that.###.###no,###no,###he's a record collector and a hot wheels collector.###.### that's we-, that's wild.###.###um, so he was off today, uh, looking at, at records.###.###uh-huh.###.### so, uh, and i was off, you know, doing, you know, hou-, household type things. you know, laundry###.###yeah.###.
77398:5	some of the people that i work with --n402278 they, like when i worked on second shift --n4022ab, um, their paren-, their kids go to school during the day	### i don't, i don't have that choice.###.###yeah,###same here.###.###um, i have --n401ae8 to be at work at, at x hour, you know, at just, at, at a certain hour###and i can't, it's not flexible.###.###yeah.###.###um, it, it --n401d89 would be nice to be able --n401dac to have flexible hours### and, and maybe after we decide --n401eba to have kids i, i might find a job that --n401eed has flexible hours.### i woul-, i hope so anyway.###um, but i would, i don't know.###.###at t i, is that where you work --n402175.###.###uh-huh.###.###it's really kind of sad,
77461:30	what's, what are some other questions they have --n403e16 --n403e1d,	###i know.###unfortunately, that's probably true.###um, do you think s-, the, the parents spend quality time with their kids### are do you think it's more like watching t v and stuff like that, not really, uh...###.### i, yeah, i, i think that, i think very few spend quality time.###i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff, stuff like that.###.###yeah.###.###i think that, um, uh, most, most kids that i see --n403a8b don't really, they don't really value quality time.###.###yeah###it's always that way unti-, until it's too late.###.### until, until they're older###and then they look back.###.###yeah,###it's true, um.
77593:15	what --n4000b1 are some of the things that you did --n4000d8 with your children when they were growing up --n4000ff.	###yeah,###you too,###i wish you the best.###.###thanks###you too.###.###okay###thanks.###.###uh, bye,###bye-bye.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###there we are --n40001e.###.###yes.### tell me,
77759:32	but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours.	###that's true,###yeah.###.###you want --n4031eb to be around for the crisis and things like that,### and, but it's not quite so much the hand-holding and peanut butter and jelly making.###.###that's right.###.###.###um, yeah,### that's, that's for sure.###that's for sure,### what do you, do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see --n403507.###.###well, it lo-, o-,###the one trend i would say --n403657 is that with so many more women choosing professional careers, there are fewer of them home in the afternoons,###.###uh-huh.###.###and i don't think it needs --n4037f7 to be the mothers,
77801:87	and you want --n40461d to be avail-, at least i've wanted --n40464c to be available, when they, for some reason, they had, they were bouncing something off of me --n4046b7. because it was something that --n4046d6 was bothering them or they were concerned about --n4046fd,	###.###even when i was there --n40410d, my boys didn't share all that much with me,###and certainly not to the extent i did with my mother --n40420d.###.###yeah,###yeah.###no,### i, i, i realize that,###but it's funny,###they don't always do it,###but occasionally they do,###and you want,###.###yeah.###uh-huh.###.###and when they do --n4044ed, there's a reason for it, that they're sharing it --n404528,###.###uh-huh.###.
77843:15	every weekend there was some visiting somewhere.	###uh-huh.###.###um, i mean, i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives --n404f6f.###.###yeah,###well, i did too.###we were close to my, uh, maternal grandparents, i mean, just a few miles, and, uh, close enough to visit my paternal grandparents, you know, quite often.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###they were fifty miles away###but,###.###see, and we're,###uh, that,### we, i, i grew up with, you know
77852:30	we, although we have some relatives in the area that we, we see --n405616, we,	###.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###they were fifty miles away###but,###.###see, and we're,###uh, that,### we, i, i grew up with, you know###every weekend there was some visiting somewhere.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, and it was sort of an italian family,###.###um.###.###um, but my children,
77887:17	and so the kids in some ways are, are, are suffering a little bit, in that, uh, the model, the role models that --n40607c get the, the, the family issues that --n4060b7 get discussed --n4060ca, and all these, i think --n4060f1 are very important parts of them growing up,	###yeah.###.### their, uh, their cousins are about ten years younger.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, uh, they never played together or anything.###.###yeah.###and i, i just sort of think yeah###.###and there are only two of them###and they didn't live in the same town.###.###that###the trend of, of families and time, where, where parents are spending less time --n405dbf,###you don't have the families, --n405ec5 too, to take up the gap.###.###that's right.###.
77906:47	but, uh, i-, it seems that there should be some continuity,	###.###and so the kids in some ways are, are, are suffering a little bit, in that, uh, the model, the role models that --n40607c get the, the, the family issues that --n4060b7 get discussed --n4060ca, and all these, i think --n4060f1 are very important parts of them growing up,###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###so we, we try --n406419 to, to do it as well as we can.###we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone,###.###uh-huh.###.###and cousins and aunts and uncles,###and we do,###but it's, although it's not the same, we are,###and that's part of, i think --n406772, teaching too, is what a family is like --n4067a1,###because then h-, how do they pattern their own --n4068a6.###.###well everyone makes its own model,
78099:19	and you could always find some channel that --n4015a1 had something on	###yeah.###.###yeah,###the same thing.###is there any, uh,###what did you think --n40101c about the coverage like over in the, uh, persian gulf.###.###i think they did a great job.###.###yeah,###i thought so too,### it was, it, you know,###for a while when we were really interested --n401276, uh, we saw it all the time.###some of the stations i guess --n40135a carried it for twenty-four hours for a couple of days there###and then, you know, the special reports and the extended news coverage i thought --n40148e was really good.###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah.###.
78212:39	and i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas,	###an.###.###oh really,### to commute to work.###.###yes,###yes.###.###oh.###.###and in the, in the morning i try --n403b5a to sleep because it's, it's dark thirty.###.###.### but in, but in the afternoon, uh, i try --n403cbc to read###so i can, can, uh, not pay attention to what our driver is doing --n403dab.###.###yeah,###i can,###the van pools i know that,###and i'm in the baltimore, washington area,
78294:14	they've had some terrible problems with hispanics,	### i, i like it, i like it a little bit better, too.###it --n40545c's interesting though, um, to meet different populations.### i, i'm just now --n405531 being, uh, from pittsburgh originally, i'm just now meeting different populations like chinese students and things###and i find that really interesting, you know, to imagine, here is --n4056f2 somebody that --n405701 was in china, le-, two years ago when all that was going on in, in, uh, beijing --n40576c.###you know, that, that's an interesting, uh, interesting perspective.###but i, i really much, much like the hometown area,###yeah.###and i think that also goes,###it's funny,### you, you can watch different news.###i can watch washington news or baltimore news###and i really do watch baltimore news.###you know, that really makes,###i don't really bother with the washington station because i just, it's so far removed from what i'm interested in --n405e03.###.###well most of what they're talking about --n405f39 in washington is, is the crime problems that they're having --n405f70 there.###.###uh-huh,###yeah### they, in fact they just, it was just a big thing recently
78394:33	i've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have --n408294 to discuss --n4082a3 are very politically motivated or whatever,	###but she had, she had le-, called and left a message on our recorder###but i had that from all my kids except for one.###.###yeah,###oh, that's good.###.###so.###.###well i guess we should stop now.###.###well i thank you for --n407fc9 calling,###i have enjoyed it.###.###uh-huh,###oh good.###.###i really do like this program because i get --n4080de to talk to people from all over the united states,###yeah.###.###uh, uh, so do i,
78562:42	if, if, if there was some place that, that we went to --n402f8f where there was hiking involved --n402fae, i, i would be you know, happy to go --n402fe9 hiking,	###.###yeah.###.###i went --n40283e skiing once.###.###yeah,### we loved the, we loved the, the new jersey area, too, because the the lakes were really pretty close, you know,### you could, you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and, and just really --n402aed,###.###uh-huh.###.###and then we weren't too for from the appalachian trail,###we did quite a bit of hiking, which --n402d14 is kind of fun.###are you a, you a hiker, or not.###.###uh,###.###not so much, huh.###.### not, not really so much.
78585:7	so some of the things are not as, quite as, uh, adaptable.	###.###but we, we never have really planned a vacation around, uh, places to go hiking --n403263.###.###so your, your next, your plans are --n40338b try --n403396 to find someplace to s-, scuba dive --n4033c5.###.###yeah.###our next vacation will, will be scuba diving,###i'm sure.###.###you have any children.###.###no,###not yet.###.###okay,###then that's probably one of the reasons our,###we had little children all the time,###.###yeah.###.
78614:111	i know that, uh, uh, one of, one thing that --n404038 happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family.	###you have --n403a7d to try --n403a8c to figure out kinds of things that you can do --n403abb that they will enjoy --n403ad2, too,###and,###.###yeah.###.###so, i think, wha-,###.###yeah,###and diving is something that,###especially for small children, uh,###i think the, the minimum age for diving is, is probably, legal anyway, would be probably about sixteen.###.###yeah.###.###.###eleven or twelve, i would think --n403f2f, probably###but, maybe fifteen even.###.###yeah.###.
78718:116	but, uh, up the coast, uh, at, uh, uh, in maryland and around there, where the, where the early history is --n4069ba, there's some	###.### he, he does that quite a bit.###.###and,###.### he, he hasn't lately, though, uh, because he's been ill,###.###yeah.###.###uh, but he's been known --n4062ac to be gone for a month or two at a time###and, you know, he'll say, this is my itinerary.###i'm going here, here and here###and i'll be back in about two months.###.###yeah.###there are a lot of neat, neat places to visit --n406573 in america,###that's for sure.### we've, i haven't been much to the south,###i haven't been in, in georgia or florida or mississippi or alabama.###i guess that's, those are the only states i have not visited --n40685c.
78762:25	but, even, even some little ones do pretty good	###.###it was really interesting.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###and then when we-, eventually, when we have kids --n407621,###.###yeah.###.###now, his, his folks did a lot of traveling across country.###you know they went to the grand canyon and did things like that.###.###well, now, camping is fun with kids.###if you're, you know,###.###yeah.###.###once they get a little bigger, not teeny tiny ones,
78991:14	if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and,	###like i didn't know what the difference between dukakis and bush was --n402d45.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, i didn't know anything about bush or dukakis.###.###so what do you think --n402eae about, uh, what do you think --n402ed5 about what you see --n402eec on t v about them, like in the news or on the ads,###do you kind of just,###.###okay,###i don't remember anything about dukakis,###.###you don't.###.###but, well they're all saying that they're going --n4031b3 to do, you know, whatever --n4031d6 is best for their campaign anyway.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###that's what i mean --n40333a,
79030:34	they have --n403fff to kind of take a stand on some things, like abortion and things like that,	###well what do you believe in --n403a90,###what do you believe in --n403afd,###they don't take any stands on anything.###they kind of say, well what do you want me to believe --n403bf0.###.###yeah.###.###or they word it so that it --n403cbe's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues --n403cf9.###.###well i'm not sure they're,###yeah.###i know how they do it --n403e90.###.###uh-huh.###.###it,###like i-, with the abortion issues and stuff.###.###uh-huh.###yeah
79355:11	they had some bends --n400e37, around that we could find and put them in --n400e66	###.###okay.###.###uh, anyhow, they have facilities --n40073b here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only.###uh, i've been recycling for maybe about two years now and, at ano-, ano-, another public facility where they have, you know, recycling of glass, uh, aluminum and paper --n4008bd.###.###uh-huh.###.###now,###.### have you, have you cycled, recycled plastic also.###.###no,###and that's what i, i don't understand --n400b93 exactly why they don't have that option --n400bba.###.### we, we have out here###uh, up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way,###.###uh-huh.###.
79451:14	or, is there some reason not to --n402ab8,	###yeah,###i would agree with that.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and there's,###.###right.###.###i've seen a few things but not very much, really###.###uh-huh.###.###and i, i think that's a shame###they need --n402800 to, uh, do a little more,###i'd like --n4028a3 to know, for instance, when i, when they say, uh, plastic, all plastic --n4028f6, what kind of plastic, can you put --n402921 all together
79557:42	i, i'm glad, --n404a6a to see some of these things, i think --n404a99.	###.###right,###right.###.###.###uh-huh,###and i'm sure, you know, in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more,###.###yeah.###.###you know, i've seen a definite trend, you know, towards more recycling, everywhere, you know, even at mcdonald's, you know, with their, their use of no, foam containers anymore.###.###yeah,###i,###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yes,
79576:31	i'm that's about my, uh, some on recycling	###yes,### i, i'm glad, --n404a6a to see some of these things, i think --n404a99.###.###.###right.### i think, i think it is getting more, you know, advertisement.###.###people are becoming more conscience --n404c95 all the time that it's necessary to do --n404cc8, and that we need --n404ce3 to somehow get away from the fact that we have --n404d12 to have everything individually wrapped,###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and all these things that,###.###right.###.###i think that's true.###well, i think,
79761:35	and he said, um, let's give her some race horse shots.	###uh, let's see,###winter before last we would bring her in, and, uh, when it was cold --n4024c5.###.###uh-huh.###.###and she wouldn't,###i, you know,###the next morning you want --n40265a to take them out,###and she wouldn't,###i couldn't get her up without --n402733 p-, picking her up and which --n402762 it was pretty hard to do --n402789 at eighty pounds.###.###i bet.###.###um, until,###if i allowed her to not get up on her own, it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon.###.###uh-huh.###.###anyway, i, uh, met###my son's, uh, college roommate, is a vet
79893:26	i, i have some neighbors across the field,	###.###that's nice,### they, they,###.###joey, on the other hand is a little different.###he has --n404f10 to go out whenever, uh, we ask him --n404f3f###and when he, when we ask him --n405002, he, uh, he barks.###he'll either bark for food,###or he'll bark --n405172 to go out###and he'll tell you which one he wants --n4051fd.###he's been through obedience school.###.###well he just can,###well he has been trained --n40532b###and you've ke-, you've kept u-, it up, haven't you.###.###oh, definitely.###.###yeah,###it is wonderful,
80001:13	i've got some applications,	###.###uh-huh.###.###so, um, during the day, i me-,###i thi-,###and i understand also they want men.###.###right,###i was going --n407040 to tell you the same thing.###they're really looking for a lot more men --n4070ee to participate.###.###yeah,###my husband does.###.###does he.###yeah,###i need --n407228 to,###.###yes.###.
80124:76	the other thing about them is too, if you really don't, you really need --n402112 to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed, and haven't developed a credit thing. it stops you from --n402189 doing a lot of things.	###or you end up in deep trouble.###.###yeah.###i made that mistake when i first got a job --n401abb###and that's kind of like,###it --n401b8e took me quite a while to pay them off,###.###uh-huh.###.###so af-, after that i decided, well, i'm not going --n401c8e to use them at all, and just try --n401cb9 to pay cash for everything###and that worked for a while###and then we got married###so we decided to, you know, if we used them we would pay them off as we go.###.###right.###.###so,###.###right.###that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances.
80218:50	and i, when i'd gotten back --n40064e i had gotten some sun that day,	###.###yeah,###i sure do.###.###what do you do --n400124.###.###uh, i ride a bicycle quite a bit and uh, work out with free weights.###.###okay,###i love --n400259 to ride a bicycle.###.###i live right near white rock lake,###so i used to, i try --n40033e to ride, about ten to twenty miles a day.###but, i haven't been doing so well this year,###.###oh, that's good.###.###but,###.### i went an, last year i went an was exercising on a bike for a while
80278:17	it's just some of those women that --n401730 come up there --n401743 looking like arnold schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it.	###yeah,###yeah,###because i'm not mumblex, i'm not big or anything,###but i'm not in great shape,### so. but when i worked out --n4013c6, i got in pretty good shape.###i didn't build up muscle, though,###i just got real good and toned.###.###yeah.###.###i don't think women look good with muscles.###.###up to a point.###.###up to a point,###no,### m-, yeah,.###.###yeah.###.
80299:13	and there's some days it's just like it --n401f41's the hardest thing in the world to, to get started --n401f80 --n401f87.	###.###yeah,###so what was, what was the other question --n4018b4,### let's see,###do you do it as a task###or do you enjoy, enjoy --n4019fa working out.###.###i guess it's a task'cause i can't make myself do it lately.###.###yeah,###i think i, uh, i enjoy it sometimes###and there's other times when i just get tired of it --n401c6b### and, and i feel like i'm obligated --n401d1d to do it, because i've been doing it###.###yeah.###.###so i should keep up.###.###you don't want --n401e9f to lose yourself.###.
80333:17	you know, how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle --n402829.	###so.###.###speakerb43-1*t43-1.###yeah,###speakeranan*t43-1.###speakera43-2*t43-2.###but, uh,###speakerbnan*t43-2.###.###it --n40231d's not hard to stay,###well if you keep --n4023b1 working out when you're young though --n4023d4, when you get older --n4023ef, you know, your body's not going --n40241a to look as bad.###i seen an old woman today,###she was about eighty###and she looked so good,###.###yeah.###.###i mean she was standing --n40268a just as straight and tall###and she had a small waist###and she didn't have, you know, like,
80438:40	but when you get into some of these, some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait --n404702 --n404709.	###.###uh-huh.###.###there used --n404040 to be one that --n404057 was a twenty-four hour that i used --n40407a to go to --n40408d###but, uh, i actually prefer --n40418e to work out alone.###.###i like --n404233 to work out with people,###.###really.###.###i need,###like you,### i, i need competition, is what i need --n404353.###.###yeah.###.###i've got --n40441d to have somebody to compete with --n404444,###or i don't want --n4044ff to do anything.###.###i wouldn't mind --n404580 having, you know, working out with a friend and, and stuff
80499:4	some people are a little bit fanatical about it.	###but i looked,###with my first little boy, i did gain a lot of weight,### i got, i got about fifty pounds overweight with him###and i didn't loose it until two years ago###and then i got pregnant and, you know, ruined that,###so.###.### just have --n405677 to start all over.###.###yeah,###well, actually, like i say, it ain't as bad this time, because i was in shape when i got pregnant --n405767.###.###right.###.### i wasn't out of sha-, i wasn't overweight when i got pregnant with him --n4058b7,###i just wasn't in, in shape.###i don't know the difference###but,###.###yeah,
80629:13	at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could	### and, uh, but i, i, i like jogging,###i don't mind that.###i can get out and do that, as long as it's not hot.###.###uh, i can't.###.###if it's hot, you can't do that.###but in the rain, oh, i love --n407d0e to run in the rain,###just, you know, be careful --n407dec not to slide.###.###yeah.###.###but you can't ride your bike at all in the rain, can you.###.###no,###you can't,###it's dangerous.###.###you slide.###.
80645:12	she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire, i think --n4087f1.	###it's dangerous.###.###you slide.###.###at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could###but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires, you slide all over the place.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###oh, i, when i did ride my friend's bike, that one time --n4081e1, i had, uh, i don't know what i was trying --n408220 to do --n40822f.###i was trying --n4083b4 to make a u turn###and i never could make a u turn in a bike,###i can do it in my car,###but i tried --n408524 to do it on that ten speed and wrecked###and i told her a dog was chasing me.###but i wrecked it into the curb.###i didn't hurt it too bad.###i scratched it on the, the oh,
80681:23	and i've been --n4003b9 buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint --n4003f8.	###anyway, have fun exercising.###.###all right.###.###all right,###bye-bye.###.###.###what kind of painting are you planning --n40002e to do --n40003d.###.###well i have wallpaper --n4000d0 in both of my bathrooms right now which --n4000f7 is really pretty disgusting.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, it's a rent house###and i decided it --n400254's too expensive to rewallpaper###so i decided i'm going --n40030d to paint.###.###uh-huh.###.
80692:12	and you get some beautiful effects with them.	###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, it's a rent house###and i decided it --n400254's too expensive to rewallpaper###so i decided i'm going --n40030d to paint.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i've been --n4003b9 buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint --n4003f8.###and i'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them. either that or maybe rag rolling. to give it kind of a country look.###oh, what would be interesting.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###i've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments,###but they look very interesting
80877:63	so you really don't have --n404fc7 to be disrupted for more than about a weekend. if you have some help.	###sure.###.###it wouldn't be any kind of special, um, special effects type thing.###.###yeah.###.###it would be just plain paint.###.###well it's not hard to do --n4049aa if you get everything prepared --n4049c5 ahead of time.###because if you, uh, use drop cloths --n404acc to cover everything and you use masking tape --n404af3 to trim out, uh, all the parts that you don't want --n404b32 to slop over onto --n404b49, you don't have --n404b64 to be quite as precise about how you do it --n404b93###and it can be done --n404dac a whole lot faster.###and with rollers and, uh, modern latex paints,###.###um, okay.###.###you can wash up easily because they're water soluble.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they dry fast
81221:70	i think you have to let, yo-, you got --n4052d5 to segregate some of it.	###.###how do you feel about it --n404c46.###i guess i, i got --n404cc7 to say, if that's the subject, if the subject is do i feel that we're well enough equipped to,###i don't know### if, if it said that. i feel i'm well enough equipped.###.###do we get enough news or something like that.###.###yeah.###to,###.### do we get, uh do we get the news that we want --n4050d3.###.###yeah.###.###and i do.###i really think.###.###yeah,###i think i do too.
81703:21	i mean, they're some of the best of, that --n407d50 are made --n407d5f.	### i i've heard about that###.###i wanted --n407a36 to see that.###.###but i don't know what it's about --n407abc.###.###the never ending story.###.###yeah.###.###it's a child's movie,###but, oh, it's good,###i enjoyed it.###.###i love disney movies.###.###yeah,###i do too###and, yeah,###.
81707:36	i think he's up in a attic, or some part of school.	###but i don't know what it's about --n407abc.###.###the never ending story.###.###yeah.###.###it's a child's movie,###but, oh, it's good,###i enjoyed it.###.###i love disney movies.###.###yeah,###i do too###and, yeah,###.###i mean, they're some of the best of, that --n407d50 are made --n407d5f.###.###yeah.###and, uh, well it's about this little boy who, uh,
81720:33	and he's trying --n40847b to save the land from some, ooze.	###i do too###and, yeah,###.###i mean, they're some of the best of, that --n407d50 are made --n407d5f.###.###yeah.###and, uh, well it's about this little boy who, uh,###i think he's up in a attic, or some part of school.###he got locked --n407fe7 in the school###and he got scared --n40804f,###but he starts --n40809c dreaming###and then, uh, he's saving the land of, uh, oh,###it's been so long since i've seen it.###.###.### all i know --n408241, alls i can really remember --n408264 is him flying this great big dog, this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing,###.###oh go-,###.###it flies through the air.
81802:32	and it's a brick house, with, uh, some wood.	###yeah,###i rented that one night by myself.###i was home --n40954e alone.###did you see home alone..###.###yes,###i did,### that, that just reminded me of that.###did you like it.###.###.###well carol since today's subject is our homes,###why don't you tell me about yours --n4000b4.###.###okay,###i live in plano, in a four bedroom, two bath house, which --n40016f is###the area's dominantly three bedroom, two bath.###so, i'm just a little bit different than typical, uh,###and of course, the plano area is basically with alleyways,###so everything around here is set --n4003a8 up that way. which i think --n4003cf is a little bit different than most areas, in the houses, the way they're constructed --n400422 --n400429.
81838:54	so it --n401606's kind of hard at that point to, you know, classify some of the builders.	###almost a hundred percent.###.###.### i, i can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision.###ours is probably the closest to it.###you know how realtors are --n400f27,###they'll say, oh this could be five bedrooms.###yeah,###if you had two people that --n401044 don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house,###.###yeah,###to.###.### don't need a closet.###.###the only thing about mine, um, i think there's probably about, oh,###when i go down the street --n4012ad i can just pick out houses that --n4012d0 are, that --n4012e3 are identical to mine###and usually they are the four bedroom, um,###but they're spaced --n401494 out, oh i'd say --n4014b3 maybe three, on a two block period.###because it's all different builders up here.
81885:137	ninety, i would say about, oh, about ninety-five percent, no i guess may-, probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick, uh, with some wood.	###yeah.###well it's like when my son goes up into the, up into the furnace area over the garage --n4024ad.###.###yeah.###.###he can walk###and he's six foot.###and he says, oh, come on up mom.###i'm not going up there.###.###.###i'm not going up there,###but he says there's plenty of room up there for a room.###so that means if i knock out the wall in my family room, i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem.###but, um, i'm not that ambitious.###i tol-,###maybe someday when i feel really ambitious and an-, get angry --n402a85 i'll start --n402a98 poking holes up there,###but until that time.###but, uh, i've noticed the houses around here are basically, it's one story and they're all basically two, uh, bath, two, uh, with three bedrooms.###and we're
81929:47	an, and while, while there are some advantages to that, there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things.	###oh.###.###so you're just as likely --n403adc to fl-, wake up and discover you're in two inches of water.###.###do you have a lot of property, i mean a lot of yard around your house now, in denton.###.###uh, it's a third of an acre.###i don't think that's a lot, uh,###in fact, i have been real disappointed --n403e7e in the six years that i've lived out here --n403ead about lot sizes.###i'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have --n403fea.###.###yeah,###when you get down closer in to the newer tract homes --n4040f8 you find almost like there's no lot line at all.###they're built --n404214 practically on top of each other.###.###that's true.###.###i know,###i was,###.
82021:22	um, we've actually had some warnings in, uh, raleigh uh, on air pollution.	###i was working at the dallas site.###my ex-husband was working downtown.###.###oh.###.###but i have, uh, no, t i as far as i concerned, they've been great as far as layoffs is concerned,###so i have no problems.###but as far as the housing, i would like, personally, i would like --n4067c8 to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller.###but prices in plano, there isn't, um, there isn't a section in plano you can really move to --n406987 without --n406992 getting caught --n4069a1###and, uh, it, my price right now, for what i pay --n406b19,###.###.###all right.###do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there.###.###um, we've got quite a few, actually.###what we're more concerned with --n400158 is the inner pollution in the city.###.###the, uh,###.
82295:13	they were doing some, uh, ozone testing, and, uh, th-, the e p a	###.###yeah.###.###well, they, um, you can really feel it, you know, in your breathing, even normal people,###and if you're older, um, i mean, you can really deplete your oxygen,###and it'll, you know, pass out,###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's, you know, it's killed several people.###.###do you, uh, smoke.###.###um, actually, i'm a very, i just smoke one in the evening if that.###so, i'm a very, very light smoker.###.### w-, yeah,###it's kind of l-,###.###it was kind of funny.
82296:18	and they were just screening some candidates,	###yeah.###.###well, they, um, you can really feel it, you know, in your breathing, even normal people,###and if you're older, um, i mean, you can really deplete your oxygen,###and it'll, you know, pass out,###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's, you know, it's killed several people.###.###do you, uh, smoke.###.###um, actually, i'm a very, i just smoke one in the evening if that.###so, i'm a very, very light smoker.###.### w-, yeah,###it's kind of l-,###.###it was kind of funny.###they were doing some, uh, ozone testing, and, uh, th-, the e p a
82440:38	well, i'm going --n407879 to have --n407888 to get some.	###.###yeah,###we used --n407350 to go --n40735f fishing in lake texoma.###.###yeah,###well, down by lake texoma there's a bunch of wooded area.###this,### but, but kentucky's beautiful.###they've got trees,###and trees are supposed --n407598 to, you know, purify.###you know what the best indoor purifying plant is --n407651 for smoke and stuff.###.### huh-, huh-uh.###.###it's a philodendron.###.###oh, really.###.###it's supposed --n4077b1 to filter the air for you, in your home.###.
82503:72	um, i, i was taking a voice i o class and, um, and actually doing some research,	###yeah,###we're down here at the bible belt, aren't we.###uh, i wasn't saved --n408578 until i got down here,###and people down here are just,###there's so many christians,###and it's so different from kentucky###but,###.###uh-huh.###how'd you get involved --n408766 in this research --n408779.###.###um, i worked at t i for a while,###but then my brother-in-law works there,###and he got me into it.###.###oh, i see.###huh.###.###how'd you get into it --n40898d.###.
82687:34	but, you know, i know there are some days when she wi-, she wishes she was back at work --n40252c.	###you know, to go from, you know, nothing, you know,###if you want --n401bec to do something every night that's fine,###but when you have children --n401cac it doesn't work that way anymore,###so.###.###that's right,###and i think a lot of people are, um, are turning to, well, i think, i think a lot of people are realizing that###but still there are so many people that --n401fd7 are, you know, have their careers first###and, it's, uh, i think it's really hurting, uh, the kids, you know,###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###but.###.###yeah,###i agree with you,### i, i, i think that my wife leaned that way###and i'm really glad she did###and, you know, i'm glad she's staying home,
82800:12	my wife did some teaching at like, uh, like a private tutoring place. a sylvan learning center this year	###.###oh.###.### an, and it takes a lot of time.###.###oh, yeah,###i'm sure it does.###.###but, um, it, you know,###we take walks, and go to the library, and try --n403fce to fill our day with things like that,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###but, um.###.###yeah,###what, uh,
82906:38	but then, then again, you know, some,	###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###um, it --n405c90's difficult, uh, to do it any other way.###.###yeah,###i understand.###.###yeah.###.### i'm, i, you know### it's, it's hard because, you know,###then you're not getting --n405f1f to spend as much time with, at home,###i mean your husband is not getting --n406015 to spend as much time --n406030 at home as he'd want --n40604f to.###.###that's right.###.###so, yeah,### that that's a tough situation,
83056:37	uh, we're probably making a comparison against, uh, some european and, uh, and, uh, uh, s-s-say, newer republics that, uh, that --n4005d2 have very high percentages.	###.###well, i, i've been, uh, i have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject --n40008a,###.###uh-huh.###.###so i'll tell you,###is it a serious problem.###yes,###i do believe it's a serious problem.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###however, there are solutions to it.###.###uh-huh.###.###and foremost, uh, where we compare w-, that we are now doing fifty percent of our, uh, people are voting.
83118:55	but part of the process also is that you must register, preregister at some particular point.	###uh...###.### i, i know here in dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, a, uh, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote --n40175b before the elections.###and they, i do not think they have seen a really high improvement.###.###have you absentee voted in, in in texas.###.###.###no.###.###.###no,###i always vote.###.###well, i have absentee voted in, uh, new hampshire,###and it is a fairly, fairly complicated process where you have --n401bcd to go --n401bdc pick up the ballot --n401bf3.###.###oh, really.###.###i do not say that it is that complicated,

83545:150	but i know you have a right to ask for a jury in, in any sort of a case that even where damages are, are, are, uh, are the result of some sort of a, uh, an action that you are bringing --n4037c2 against someone else --n4037d5. you can ask for that to be heard --n403800 before a jury.	###or,###.###uh, i do not know exactly what the size of the juries.###i know one of my friends was, uh, uh, brought --n4030b4 up for jury duty.###.###yeah.###.###for,###and he only heard very, you know, piddly type cases.###most of it was, uh, robberies or things like that, you know,###it was not any serious crimes.###so apparently even for the smallest crimes, they give the person the, you know, any felony anyways.###.###yeah.###well, i guess we,###.### th-, they give the person the option for a jury.###.###yeah.###i guess we always focus on criminal trials with th-, with the jury.
83552:52	takes a heck of a long time, i guess, to get there in some states.	###for,###and he only heard very, you know, piddly type cases.###most of it was, uh, robberies or things like that, you know,###it was not any serious crimes.###so apparently even for the smallest crimes, they give the person the, you know, any felony anyways.###.###yeah.###well, i guess we,###.### th-, they give the person the option for a jury.###.###yeah.###i guess we always focus on criminal trials with th-, with the jury.###but i know you have a right to ask for a jury in, in any sort of a case that even where damages are, are, are, uh, are the result of some sort of a, uh, an action that you are bringing --n4037c2 against someone else --n4037d5. you can ask for that to be heard --n403800 before a jury.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
83611:44	so has our, i guess our population has grown some too.	###i can not think of the word i am looking for --n404a3d.###anyway, the deterrent. for people to, to commit the cri-, uh, to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away.###.###yes.###.###people have,###i do not know,###they just do not care any more.###the benefit, i guess --n404d6e, of crime outweighs what the deterrent is --n404d95.###.###uh, and yet there are, there are so many, there are so many people in prison.###.###you know, people that,###.###i mean the prison population, uh, as far as i, i, uh, you know,###my impression of it is that it has, that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty.###.###um.###.###i mean it,
83780:16	but there's just some little difference that, um, --n401c50 causes it not to work an i-,	###he hooked it up right.### it, it was just that the, the part just, just didn't fit the car,###so. i took it back###and, uh, he, he took the alter-, the guy in, in the parts shop took the alternator###and he put it on the little thing he has --n400f1e in there --n400f31 to test them###and, uh, he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator###so we, we went back and tried it again, put it on again###and it still didn't work,###and we took the car up to, um, a little place called pep boys,###i don't know if you have them in your area###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, they're, they're pretty reasonable, uh, car repair place also.###so, uh, took it up there, towed it up there because it, you know, wouldn't start or anything###and this thing just kept --n4015d3 blowing out the fuses###and, uh, took them about an, an hour --n40167d to, um, figure out what --n4016a0 was, what --n4016b3 was blowing the fuse,###and it was, it was the alternator that --n40182a was blowing the fuse.###anyway, ended up --n401901 taking it to the toyota dealer###and the only problem was that, uh, it had --n4019b8 to be a genuine toyota, uh, alternator because most of the other ones that they say --n401a0b will fit it, that, that, you know, they sit in there and everything
83966:23	it was starting --n406100 to burn some oil.	###so the engine never got put --n405c21 back together again.###.###huh, oh well.###.###i,###.###i was driving a sixty-six plymouth fury.###.###wow.###i think those old cars might, might be a pretty good bet because you,###.###yeah,###yeah,###and, oh, tha-, that's when they made cars --n405ec4, though,###.###i don't know,###i-,###.### this things was, the body was in good condition###and mumblex you know, it ran fine.
83988:6	and some people will still buy them, you know,	###uh-huh.###um. uh-huh,###.### and, um, but i had --n4061dc to, you know, ge-,###you know, i, mumblex after about thr-, couple of months after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my car###so.###.###i read a book --n4064a0 one time that --n4064b3 said that the best cars were made --n4064d6 before seventy-four.###.###yeah,###well, you know, these, these cars made in the sixties and stuff,###i mean the steel, i mean, the thickness,###i mean, i-, those thin-, they're just, th-,###you just don't see cars like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they last a long time.###and they were simple too,###the engines were simple and durable

85235:65	so it --n4002a4's kind of hard for me to tell what --n4002cf would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland,	###yep.###.###well, uh, that's about all i can think --n403fe4 to talk about --n403ff7 right now.###it --n4040ce's been a pleasure talking with you.###.###okay.###.### thank you.###.###right.###.###bye.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###um, what do you think the major cause of air pollution or at least in the boston areas,###.###well, the, the, the major cause it seems --n40014b up here is exc-,###i live right on the ocean
85252:8	interestingly some of the information i've been reading --n400c28 indicates that the amount of air pollution from, uh, uh, airplanes is extraordinary.	###.###well, the, the, the major cause it seems --n40014b up here is exc-,###i live right on the ocean###so it --n4002a4's kind of hard for me to tell what --n4002cf would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland,###.###uh-huh.###.###but the major cause here, and we always seem --n400447 to, and it seems --n400462 to be validated --n400475 by the press, is the car pollution.###we don't have too much industrial pollution.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###uh, car pollution seems --n40064d to be the one and only thing that, that i can really put my finger on --n400698 here.###.###um, that isn't the same in the washington area because we don't have any major, um, industry except for, uh, government and services.###and the, the transportation situation is such that, uh, all the car pollution is, is absolutely awful.###um, also the worth of the hub of three airports###in this general area there is, uh, national, dulles, and then, uh, baltimore, washington.###and it,
85724:16	um, there are some areas --n403601 though where, where they have a problem with, uh, the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the, to the, uh --n403680,	###right.###.###.### i haven't, i haven't, i have yet --n403190 to see a basement in a house.###.###huh.###.###and, uh,###.###maybe it's all the sand.###is there a lot of sand in,###i always think it's like a desert,###i don't know.###mumblex dallas always,###.###well, no.###no,###no,###no,###you know, i don't see that kind of sand here.
85728:68	or the foundation is sinking or something. you know, just a little, just a little bit, some more than others.	###.###huh.###.###and, uh,###.###maybe it's all the sand.###is there a lot of sand in,###i always think it's like a desert,###i don't know.###mumblex dallas always,###.###well, no.###no,###no,###no,###you know, i don't see that kind of sand here.###um, there are some areas --n403601 though where, where they have a problem with, uh, the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the, to the, uh --n403680,###.###uh-huh.###.
85881:104	i guess we're going --n400239 to have a lot of parades --n400258 this weekend in honor of these guys that --n40027f are, that --n400292 did some stuff over in the gulf.	###uh-huh.###.###so. i stayed in a townhouse for, uh, two years and then, uh, saved up enough money to, to get a,###.###.###hello.###.###hello.###.###hi, um,###this is betty###and i'm in richardson, texas.###.###i'm nola###and i'm in plano.###.###oh, okay,###well here we go --n4001da.###.###.
85965:39	and, and, uh,, i think some different things --n402ca6 could come from what --n402cbd's happened --n402ccc, than what we expect --n402ce7.	###.###yeah.###.### i, i guess, you know, i'd like you to maybe express something here.###.###well i, i, i think overall that's right.###i think it's kind of sad --n402520 though, that, for generations they've been taught --n40254f to hate each other.###.###yeah.###.###and that's, i-, you know,###if,###somewhere in there someone's going --n40273b to have --n40274a to learn a different way.###.###that's,###yeah.###.###you know, an, an, i, i think that, um,###true we do have completely different ways of looking at things, at a lot of things,###but, uh, at the same time, i think there are a lot of, there is a lot of good that the united states and other countries can do --n402af5, as far as example
86088:57	and i, i think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these, uh, newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the, the, uh, soldiers leaving, um, you know, surrendering and, trying --n405cb8 to get out of that situation.	###.###yes,###and they abuse that.###.###and it's always been military###and it's always been,###and that's, that's always been the way of the world. don't you think.###.###which i think that --n40550f that's not the, the way the majority of the people over there really are --n40555a.###.###yeah.###so it's really hard, when you see the leaders, compared to the people --n4056ca.###.###but i think in a, in a way the war, uh, i think in a way all, the involvement over there too, though, has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that --n405837 don't follow what those few are doing --n40585e.###and there are a lot of people who --n405acc are good people.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###you know, there's,
86100:21	you have --n4060c5 to have some compassion some humanness.	###.###but i think in a, in a way the war, uh, i think in a way all, the involvement over there too, though, has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that --n405837 don't follow what those few are doing --n40585e.###and there are a lot of people who --n405acc are good people.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###you know, there's,###and i, i think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these, uh, newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the, the, uh, soldiers leaving, um, you know, surrendering and, trying --n405cb8 to get out of that situation.###.###right###and surrendering,###that was,###.###.###yeah.###.### and, and, the, you know,###.###it just really comes down to people are people, you know,
86100:26	you have --n4060c5 to have some compassion some humanness.	###.###but i think in a, in a way the war, uh, i think in a way all, the involvement over there too, though, has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that --n405837 don't follow what those few are doing --n40585e.###and there are a lot of people who --n405acc are good people.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###you know, there's,###and i, i think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these, uh, newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the, the, uh, soldiers leaving, um, you know, surrendering and, trying --n405cb8 to get out of that situation.###.###right###and surrendering,###that was,###.###.###yeah.###.### and, and, the, you know,###.###it just really comes down to people are people, you know,
86408:11	in fact some of the days we froze.	###.###uh-huh.###.###and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go --n4012df.### and, so we, we didn't really have enough time.###.###yeah.###oh i'm sure it was wonderful.###.###we had about, a little bit less than two weeks.###.###uh-huh.###.###and as always, it don-, it seems a bit, uh, rushed.###we do a lot of traveling around.###we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.###.###was it hot.###.###no,
86451:40	the only thing i didn't like --n4023c1 was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged --n402418 by people wanting to be your guide	###.### at wha-, at, excuse me, at what age did you,###.###.###oh, that's too bad###because,###.###so i don't remember###but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been --n401f9b,###.###uh-huh.###.###and that i was when i was a baby --n40207a### but so, morocco i think --n402124 would be wonderful###.###.###because that's, you know, that's, that area of the world i think would be great.###.###yeah.###it was a very interesting vacation.
86455:28	and you, there were some places, where people, defini-,	###oh, that's too bad###because,###.###so i don't remember###but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been --n401f9b,###.###uh-huh.###.###and that i was when i was a baby --n40207a### but so, morocco i think --n402124 would be wonderful###.###.###because that's, you know, that's, that area of the world i think would be great.###.###yeah.###it was a very interesting vacation.###the only thing i didn't like --n4023c1 was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged --n402418 by people wanting to be your guide###.###uh-huh.###.
86489:22	what we did --n40321c in some of the other cities and they tell you --n40324b to do that is to hire a local guide	###.### we, we found that in jamaica. it was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, well try and sell drugs and things like that###.###uh-huh.###.###but they, they were so destitute###and i guess they, they make all their money on tourism### and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want --n402d62 to buy different things###and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,###.###yeah.###.###you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you --n402f81.###.### the, the worst place was in marrakech###.###uh-huh.###.###and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad###and a couple of them it was,
86821:22	but you figure you got some drug guy out there that --n401a6d's got an uzi machine gun, uh, a thirty-eight, uh,	###because everybody that --n4012d8's in drug trafet-, trafficking has got them.###.###they have got them outgunned --n4013c0.###.###you know.###yeah.###so.###.###there was a an article in the paper just this week where i think it's, uh, --n4014d4 one of the gun companies, i can't remember which, was developing a ten metal, ten millimeter automatic pistol for the f b i which --n40154b would give them additional firepower --n401566.###.###um.###.###it had, held like a fifteen shot clip, which, uh, --n4017d6 would be able, th-, they would be able --n401809 to put down anything that --n401824 came at them --n401837,###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###that would be,###.
87075:57	you know, i don't want --n406787 to get out there --n40679e deer hunting and have some guy blow me away,	### and, and, uh, he taught me how to shoot, uh, a old single shot twenty-two --n40617e###.###all right.###.###and, i was probably about twelve at the time,###.###uh-huh.###.###and i thought that was the neatest thing###and, of course uncle sam took me out, took me hunting with him###.###yeah.###.###and he let me shoot and showed me how.###.###all right.###i think there is a lot of responsibility --n40653a on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever --n406575 is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one --n4065b4.###.###right.###.
87128:10	there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington. regardless of the racial makeup,	###.###however, i have been persuaded --n4005eb, lately, i guess --n40060a, simply by the, uh, overwhelming data that --n400639 seems --n400644 to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime.###.###more especially where you are --n4007ef.###are you, in washington d c or washington state.###.###well, yeah.###.###.###no,### i am in, i am in washington d c.###.###yeah,###yeah,###i was going --n4009fa to say,###.###actually it,###you know, i do a lot of business here,###and i come here quite often### and, and that again is a, is a sort of media perception
87169:46	you know, the, the immediate need to show some sort of violence --n40220f to settle th-, the argument.	### what do you, what do you think --n4016b6 is causing all this,###.###well,###.###because, it seems that there###even though###crime, though i think it is increasing in number, it sure does seem --n401859 to be increasing in intensity, and violence too.###.###yes.###.###.###well, i, i have three theories about it, you know, three things.###i have one theory,###and it's brought --n401ae4 to us by two things.###one i, i believe that this is a function of, uh, the violence that young people see --n401bb0 on television and the movies.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, i am not just talking about, you know, uh, role models of gu-, of tough guys and gangsters and things like that,### i am not even, i am not even convinced --n401ea7 that maybe things like football, hockey and, th-, th-, the, you know, the, and even baseball games now where the, everything is settled --n401f5a with a fight --n401f6d.
87172:63	and, and then i, i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree,	###.###because, it seems that there###even though###crime, though i think it is increasing in number, it sure does seem --n401859 to be increasing in intensity, and violence too.###.###yes.###.###.###well, i, i have three theories about it, you know, three things.###i have one theory,###and it's brought --n401ae4 to us by two things.###one i, i believe that this is a function of, uh, the violence that young people see --n401bb0 on television and the movies.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, i am not just talking about, you know, uh, role models of gu-, of tough guys and gangsters and things like that,### i am not even, i am not even convinced --n401ea7 that maybe things like football, hockey and, th-, th-, the, you know, the, and even baseball games now where the, everything is settled --n401f5a with a fight --n401f6d.###you know, the, the immediate need to show some sort of violence --n40220f to settle th-, the argument.###.###.
87190:11	that's some of the things i think --n4029cf about it,	###.###.### and, and then i, i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree,###so i think that particularly### i, i was reading the other day about, uh, corpus christi, texas which --n4024f6 has the mumblex the highest,###i think it's corpus christi, that --n402645 had the highest rates per hand gun death in america uh, per capita.###.###um.###.###.###yeah,### i was, i have not seen that,###but, uh,###.###i mean the saturday night special stuff###so,###.###yeah.###.### that, that's what i think --n402908 about it,
87196:73	it seems anymore, uh, a movie can not be considered --n402c2e good unless there's just some, some sort of violence, or something in it.	###.###um.###.###.###yeah,### i was, i have not seen that,###but, uh,###.###i mean the saturday night special stuff###so,###.###yeah.###.### that, that's what i think --n402908 about it,###that's some of the things i think --n4029cf about it,###plus i do not know,###what are your views --n402ac7.###.###well, yeah,###i tend --n402b4d to agree with you with, you know,
87240:87	and i, i, i, i have --n403ec3 to think that, that it has some influence on it.	###yeah.###.###and i am sure that it does form role models for young, for young men and young women###and,###.###yeah.###.###uh, i mean i, i, read now where we are --n40390d, you know,### women are arr-, young women are arrested --n403a37 --n403a3e fighting with knives over, over whatever. mumblex whatever reason, which --n403a89 is kind of unheard of when i was young --n403ab4.###.###um.###.###now, i do not want --n403c8f to sound like an old fart,###but, that's what###.###.### seems that those things happened befor-, did not happen in that manner before television.###.###yeah.###.
87257:72	and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was, just some of the things that he believed in --n404522, some of his morals.	###.###yeah.###.###and i, i, i, i have --n403ec3 to think that, that it has some influence on it.###but,###.###i listened to a radio talk show --n404072 today at lunch time uh, rush lynn bottom###.###yeah.###.###i do not know if you listen to him or not,###.###no.###.###he's on a m,###but, ther-, there's a fellow that --n404272 had called in and was lamenting about the,###there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for los angeles, the guy under gates,###.###oh, yes.###.
87257:107	and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was, just some of the things that he believed in --n404522, some of his morals.	###.###yeah.###.###and i, i, i, i have --n403ec3 to think that, that it has some influence on it.###but,###.###i listened to a radio talk show --n404072 today at lunch time uh, rush lynn bottom###.###yeah.###.###i do not know if you listen to him or not,###.###no.###.###he's on a m,###but, ther-, there's a fellow that --n404272 had called in and was lamenting about the,###there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for los angeles, the guy under gates,###.###oh, yes.###.
87467:20	uh, she can't eat some cream cheese.	###.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###well, yeah,###that's true.###and we have a gourmet friend that --n402690 can't stand fish###so i mean he can get within,###.###oh, yeah,###well, one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all.###.###oh, my.###.###uh, so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese.###.###oh, yeah.###.###uh, well, i take that back.
87654:14	i guess some of the best things i've ever had --n406093, um, i, some of them were just hors d'oeuvres, you know.	###.### that ar-, but those are homemade.###they are not, um, commercial bakery made.###and in that they are made --n405b57 in their homes, um,###so it, it's kind of interesting, uh,###it's out there if you want --n405c99 to pay the price###but,###.###oh, it is.###i mean, we have bakeries around here that, you know, you, you just gain weight --n405de6 going by the door --n405dfd##, you know, just like that.###.###right,###.###.###just smelling the air.###yeah.###.###right,###but i don't know
87654:69	i guess some of the best things i've ever had --n406093, um, i, some of them were just hors d'oeuvres, you know.	###.### that ar-, but those are homemade.###they are not, um, commercial bakery made.###and in that they are made --n405b57 in their homes, um,###so it, it's kind of interesting, uh,###it's out there if you want --n405c99 to pay the price###but,###.###oh, it is.###i mean, we have bakeries around here that, you know, you, you just gain weight --n405de6 going by the door --n405dfd##, you know, just like that.###.###right,###.###.###just smelling the air.###yeah.###.###right,###but i don't know
88001:23	that would provide, uh, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see.	###yeah.###.###.###then again the, the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent,###and the public, colleges also, the tuition has got --n401e58 to be among the lowest in the country.###.###yeah.###.###uh,###.###yeah.###.###one of the,###uh, i believe, i don't know which one it is --n401fe2 --n401fe9, uh, down there whether it's hobby or, uh, the other ex-governor down there that --n40203c are proposing --n40204b doubling the tuition.###well if you double the tuition, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states.###.###yeah,###i think that's right.###.###yeah.
88001:41	that would provide, uh, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see.	###yeah.###.###.###then again the, the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent,###and the public, colleges also, the tuition has got --n401e58 to be among the lowest in the country.###.###yeah.###.###uh,###.###yeah.###.###one of the,###uh, i believe, i don't know which one it is --n401fe2 --n401fe9, uh, down there whether it's hobby or, uh, the other ex-governor down there that --n40203c are proposing --n40204b doubling the tuition.###well if you double the tuition, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states.###.###yeah,###i think that's right.###.###yeah.
88070:6	and some, people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car --n4045a0.	###.###yeah,###and the other thing is that when it, when it's, the public transportation is established --n403844 that early on --n403857 then, then the business, uh, business and residential patterns develop --n40389e to take advantage of that.###.###absolutely.###.###whereas in, in, uh, in dallas here we've, we've got, uh, those patterns were well established before, before we really tried to, tried --n403b8a to do the dart.###and, uh, for instance all the, all the, the, uh, office buildings and stuff that --n403e21 are out here in, in, uh, north dallas as opposed to downtown,###uh, to try to, to try --n404013 to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the, the metroplex to, to, uh, both those centers of, of business plus everything else that --n4040a6's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area. you know, like new york does,###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###yeah,### just take like in chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere --n404449.###.###yeah.###.###new york
88596:12	and there's some,	###.###oh.###.###and we got,###uh, the one that my parents have --n400892 is an apple two e.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i have a sister-in-law who --n40095e is, who --n400971 works in the fort worth school district.###.###uh-huh.###.###and so she got me copies of, uh, several of the apple programs for school programs,###.###great.###.###.###yeah.###.###and so we use those
88662:24	ours really needs --n401e56 to have some work done --n401e71 on it	###.###yeah,###yeah.###um, i n-, i'm a, a writer by profession###and, uh, when, when i was first here in, in dallas or in plano --n401877, um, and was finally able to, this is, oh, been like fourteen years ago we moved here --n4018de. and i was finally able --n4018fd to afford a new typewriter,###and i got an i b m selectric.###i thought i had died and gone to heaven because, i thought, oh, they're so wonderful.###.###oh.###.###.###i have one of those.###yeah.###.###well, then, um,###.###mine's broke at the moment,###but.###.###yeah,
88674:10	i did some typing for my father when he had the company --n402505	###yeah.###.###well, then, um,###.###mine's broke at the moment,###but.###.###yeah,###ours really needs --n401e56 to have some work done --n401e71 on it### but, but then my husband, um, worked at t i### and i got a, um, this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore,###but he got a, um, uh, the, the t i professional and brought that home###and i learned wordstar on that,###.###oh.###.###and, boy once that happened, there was just no way that i could ever go back to --n40229f doing anything of length of the typewriter --n4022c2.###.###yeah,### i learned, i, i learned wordstar, uh,
88706:22	and also, um, i do some work at u t d	###that's the one that my father,###well, i guess i have used it once or twice.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, it's the one that --n402930's on my father-in-law's computer.###.###right.###.###he's got on i b m.###.###yeah,###yeah.###that's probably where you've used it --n402aaa.###.### and, uh, so that's the program that they're using --n402b55 there.###.###uh-huh.###yeah. um,###i have that on my, uh, computer here
88719:5	some of the commands just had nothing to do --n4034c5 with, you know, what you were supposed --n4034f4 to be doing --n403507 what they, what they did --n403536 on the com-, computer	###that's probably where you've used it --n402aaa.###.### and, uh, so that's the program that they're using --n402b55 there.###.###uh-huh.###yeah. um,###i have that on my, uh, computer here###and also, um, i do some work at u t d###and, uh, that's what they have --n402d8e there###and it --n402e0a was just so nice to be able just --n402e35 to step into the position and, and already know the langu-, you know, already know the, the software.###and, um, i don't know from my own experience, um,###wordperfect is just so much better than, than wordstar at least the version of wordstar that i used --n40312a to have --n403139.###it may be improved by now###but,###.###that's what i've heard --n4032df.###.###yeah,### it's, uh, wordstar was never very intuitive to me.###i mean you know, you,
88744:99	and if you add it, if you put a footnote in, in the middle, you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have --n403fb6 to footnote it, you just change, um, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you.	###i mean like going, um, forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing###just, you know, didn't match with the kinds of keys, you were using --n4038eb.###.###yeah,###you had --n4039db to, memorize it,###.###.###yeah.###.###and,###.### and, but wordperfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways.### and you, and it does a lot of things too that if you, if you do any kind of, uh, research or anything like that where you have --n403be7 to, uh, use footnotes --n403c06, it is just wonderful. because it keeps track of all your footnotes.###.###oh.###.###.###oh, that's neat.###.###yeah,
88772:47	so, um, if you, um, unless you have some other things you want --n404a9f to talk about --n404ab2 as having --n404ac5 to do with p c --s.	###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###and i think about how it used --n4044ac to be --n4044bb if you were doing a paper and you had --n4044e6 to go back and retype everything,###and oh, it was just awful.###so, um, i don't know i think we have just become really spoiled.###but i think, it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled --n4047ae.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###i agree.###.###so, um, well, i have not really paid much attention because i###clock,###.###.###although i think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes
88808:43	although, um, i have also done oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing.	###.### excuse me.###.###oh, sure.###.### go on and talk to daddy about it.### tell daddy i unplugged it for you.###but you don't need --n405205 to drag it down the hall.###.### got a problem, huh.###um,###.### daddy, daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that i had unplugged --n405346.###.###oh. trying to figure out what all that was about --n405456, huh..###.###yeah.###.###but, um, i have,###um, that, that was the majority of my writing
88810:12	so i did some advertising and p r	###.###oh, sure.###.### go on and talk to daddy about it.### tell daddy i unplugged it for you.###but you don't need --n405205 to drag it down the hall.###.### got a problem, huh.###um,###.### daddy, daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that i had unplugged --n405346.###.###oh. trying to figure out what all that was about --n405456, huh..###.###yeah.###.###but, um, i have,###um, that, that was the majority of my writing###although, um, i have also done oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing.###and, um, for a while i had a, um, uh, a partnership with a, in an advertising agency with another woman who --n40576f is a, an artist.
88828:16	i'm anxious --n405ff0 some day to have one here.	###although, um, i have also done oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing.###and, um, for a while i had a, um, uh, a partnership with a, in an advertising agency with another woman who --n40576f is a, an artist.###so i did some advertising and p r###but,###.###huh.###.###um, now i'm, actually i'm, i'm not working anymore.### i'm a student, i'm a graduate student###so i'm doing a lot of writing###but, uh, now all of the sc-, scholastic majors though,###.###yeah.###.###i've done a little, a lot of different kinds,###but i, i just know right now that i couldn't have put out half of what i did --n405d64 if that much without the being in computers###so that's been really great.### and, uh, i'm, so i'm real spoiled.###.###yeah.
89068:107	but, uh, so when you are first going to school --n402c0e that, you kind of have the luxury of --n402c39 being able --n402c48 to have some latitude in choosing the place to go --n402c83.	###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, you know, i guess, you know, when you have --n4024cb to do it that way --n4024e6, it makes, makes your choices a lot easier###but,###.###uh, that's true.###yeah,### that, that's like, you know, when i went on --n40272e to get my, my master's --n40275d i, uh, basically was, you know, it was where i was --n4027a0 at the time.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###you know, i was not going --n4029ea to try --n4029f9 to pick --n402a08 and go somewhere else because i was pretty much settled###.###right,###right.###.###and i was trying --n402b71 to work.
89180:32	i, i was involved in some, uh, oh, alumnae recruiting, uh, here in town, uh, recently, uh, well last year.	###.###um, because you went there.###.###yeah,###because they, uh, allow for, uh, uh, tuition, uh, break for out of state students who --n404630 children of alumnae.###.###um.###.###.###i didn't know that.###.###well certain schools do it.###.###yeah.###.###this school does.###so, uh, it's, it mumblex,###.###huh.###.
89238:15	and she was wanting some more information.	###.###and so, i, i was real, real pleased with that.###that worked out so well.###.###yeah.###so did you drum up any interest then###or, well, that's good.###.###i think so.###.###.###i don't know offhand###but, uh, it seemed like there were quite a few kids that --n4058a0 were definitely interested in --n4058b7 going there.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, there, there was one mother who, uh, --n4059ef came by right, even, before we started, who, who --n405a36 obviously was, uh, very interested in --n405a5d getting her, her daughter in or, or having gotten her daughter in or something###.###and that,###.
89259:13	i think some parents go a little bit overboard.	###but she was, her, her daughter was, uh, a, a, ma-, ma-, dru-, a majorette or something. you know, a baton twirler or something###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and she was she was, letting us know she, mumblex how, how good her daughter was --n40609f.###.###.###she had cards printed up, actually describing, you know, business cards describing her daughter's, uh, you know,###she had won several different twirling awards, and all this,###.###oh, really.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and she was, had these business cards she was passing --n40642f out###and it was quite a production.
89309:4	some i don't.	###the last,###see i went about two or three weeks ago and saw f x two###and that is a really good movie, if you like special effects,###kind of gory and lots of, you know action.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###i have not done that one,###i don't know if i have even heard of that one.###.###um, do you know that i don't follow performers,###.###oh.###.###i don't follow actors.###some i know,###.###uh-huh.###.
89352:11	what are some others that you have seen --n4017e8 lately --n4017f3.	###at any rate, i also saw not long ago once around.###that was with richard dreyfuss.###.###okay.###.###and, that one was just a very poignant story,### it, it, it had people,### it was, it was you know, a lot of people said it was a really funny movie,###but it was, a very, it was a poignant humor###.###uh-huh.###.###and there was, it was like, uh, uh, steel magnolias.###the characters played very well off one another.###.###uh-huh.###.###and there was humor involved,###but the story was a very dramatic story,###and i enjoyed it very much.
89437:12	and there were some others,	###.###uh-huh.###.###if you are going --n40299e to be planning on doing that,###now i was warlock --n402a60 too, which --n402a73 is supposed --n402a82 to be the story of a, uh, witch hunt that --n402ab9 is, you know, magically shot --n402adc into the present time.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was, i was very well persuaded --n402cb9 to walk out. very well persuaded,###there was more gore than i was interested in seeing.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, as the movie settles down to a comfortable action, uh, i can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either.###but, uh, the action was comfortable###.###yeah.###.###and, of course, i enjoyed those good guy, bad guy type conflicts things.###so, i enjoyed that movie, after the first few minutes of gore.
89480:63	they say if you really want --n404029 to be, uh, you really want some suspense, that's the one to see --n40407c.	###.###yeah.###.###and, he has done a really good job of --n4038d2 characterizing the, uh, disabled person.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, of course, robin williams always just has a, an air about him that you can't help but enjoy --n4039fc what he is doing --n403a13.###even when he's sad --n403b61, you know, you great faith that he will get happy again.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then, oh, let's see, there's a couple or three that i would like --n403cda to go --n403ce9 see --n403cf4 before they go into videos.###i guess, i can wait another month###and they will be videos.###.###yeah.###.###one is silence of the lambs.###i've heard a lot about that one.
89580:13	and i enjoy some of the michael j. fox movies.	###yeah,###i didn't care for the type of movie,###but he was always slick, and greasy, and seemed --n405cd3 to be conceited and had more women than he needed###and i didn't like him.###but, he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older.###.###yeah,###i thought he looked real good with a beard, too.###.###oh, yeah,###yeah,###he does###and there is just a, there's a,###i don't know, uh,###i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning, whether he is or not --n40616a.###.###yeah.###.###and he, he has that merry look about his eyes that --n4062a6 looks like he stays in mischief all time.###and, i enjoy those,
89825:63	see, when you have kids --n4044d3, you like --n4044e6 to be able --n4044f9 to, send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them --n404540.	###they are huge when you are inside them --n403e77.###.###yeah.###.###they are very spacious.###they are, you know,### i was, mumblex i was in one today.###it was forty two hundred square feet.###.###uh.###.###yeah.###uh-huh.###.###well see that's,###the house that we got --n404162 is small enough so my husband and i,###because there's just the two of us###and the two cats, um, can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard --n4042ec.###and we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know.###.
90033:32	and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from --n402432. is when people have --n40244d to put people in a nursing homes --n402470	###right,###uh-huh.###.### and, and, but it's a very expensive solution.###.###well, it's, you know,###i think we just, you know, listen to, is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes.###it's just a matter of finding, a good home.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.### and, and then, of course, there is always the problem of being able, able --n4021af to afford either of those solutions.###.###right.###uh-huh.###.###and that, i think --n402341 is what --n402350 is scary,
90039:83	and, uh, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who --n4027dc had, had, uh, apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating --n40281b.	###i think we just, you know, listen to, is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes.###it's just a matter of finding, a good home.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.### and, and then, of course, there is always the problem of being able, able --n4021af to afford either of those solutions.###.###right.###uh-huh.###.###and that, i think --n402341 is what --n402350 is scary,###and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from --n402432. is when people have --n40244d to put people in a nursing homes --n402470###and they really can not afford the best.###.###right.###and that's right,### i, well i took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation --n4026c9
90051:29	so, i told them he strangled on some chicken	###.###and that, i think --n402341 is what --n402350 is scary,###and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from --n402432. is when people have --n40244d to put people in a nursing homes --n402470###and they really can not afford the best.###.###right.###and that's right,### i, well i took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation --n4026c9###and, uh, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who --n4027dc had, had, uh, apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating --n40281b.###.###oh.###.###and, uh, he had apparently had not been in the home too long, just a week or so,###but when they, the family came in --n402aa1 to see him --n402ab4, they had not been made --n402ad3 aware,###i was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance --n402c05###and i overheard their conversation.###and when the family walked in --n402cfc, his wife and daughter and son-in-law, they were not even aware of what --n402d3f had happened.###.###oh, goodness.###.
90144:26	but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there	###oh, my.###.###.###um.###.###as the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from, from people who --n40478d have been independent all their lives.###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.###like this was a really neat vital woman###and you get in a nursing home###and the first thing that --n4049bd happens you have --n4049d0 to share your, your whole living space, with someone that you have never known --n404a17 before in your life.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###and oh i, i do not know what the answer is --n404bd1,
90230:11	he had some accomplices that --n40169d were kind of suspect,	###who --n400620 wrote that.###.###oh, i do not remember the man's name,###he was, used --n4006f9 to be a reporter for, uh, i think --n400728, the new york times, or the washington post, one of the two,###and he supposedly got this, this, s-, story, uh, i mean this, uh, was contacted --n400910 by this guy who --n40092b had these, these memos he wanted --n400952 to sell --n400961,###and they were, they were ones that --n400ba2 had supposedly been stolen --n400bb9 from the, uh, corporate headquarters in, uh, in los angeles.###.###huh.###.###they,###on i think it was --n400d84 romain drive or romain street or something, there in los angeles, they used to have a, or, i guess they still do, uh, had a, uh, uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which --n400e43 had offices###and it was sort of nondescript for a, uh, you know, for the size of the company###which, --n401153 inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected --n401192,### he, he was, uh, a great collector of everything,### he, he, he did not, he did not throw anything away###and, uh, supposedly this guy had, had been breaking there for awhi-,###he was a, like, you know, burglar, had been breaking there awhile and, uh, and had ended up,###.###i see.###.
90848:29	and it was not only in mississippi, in some other places, as well,	###all local.###were they like all in dallas.###.###uh, no, no not, no,###this was, well,###i am actually from mississippi,###and, so that's,###.###oh.###.### it, it was around there generally.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###uh, that's where the family grew --n4008f1.###.###just from city to city then mumblex.###.###yeah,
90995:20	i think that's some of it.	###.###uh-huh.###.###but that's just how it is --n40349c.###my mother was complaining last year about th-, you know,###it's dwindling down every year,###you know, that's just, i think that's just,###.###is that just family's lack of priority, anymore, maybe###yes,###.###.###we get so involved in our work lives and just, social lives and so forth.###.###well, yeah.###.###.###yeah,###that's, uh,###yeah,
91041:57	but, then again, uh, well, i, you know, i have some aunts that, uh, i, i, i do --n404b63.	###i mean i still do kind of enjoy it,###but, uh, it's, it does not, it's not as many people there that i really, really enjoy --n40457e seeing --n404589.###.###right,###right.###.###you know, i,###it's going just for the sake of getting together,###i think for the family.###and,###.###do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that --n4048d0's in that group.###on a regular basis, not just christmas cards.###.###uh,###.###.###um, um, no,###not really.### tha-, in that,
91119:18	so you probably could give some great advice.	###i sent it, on to the next one,###.###yeah.###.### and, and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in scottsdale, arizona, for that family.###.###uh-huh.###.###we are real glad we got together because since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left.###and the sister-in-law died###and the sister is in a nursing home,###so, we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago.###.###.###well, steve, did you go to college.###.###yeah.###in fact, i'm still going.###.###oh, that's good.
91184:148	i, i think i'd, i'd advise a parent --n401a6d to send a kid to a school --n401a90, though, that --n401aa7 has a number of different types of programs, you know, that, uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer --n401b26,	###.###yeah.###.### an, and, i mean, choosing from my experience, you know, i thought, you know, my, i know what i want --n40110b a lot more than my parents know what i want --n40113a.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, i don't know,###at the same time, you have --n4013b5 to decide what --n4013c8 is important about the school,###you know, the size of it or,###.###yeah.###i think that's more important --n401544 probably than even the career vocation, because most people change.###.###yeah.###.### i kn-, i know very few people that, uh, --n401673 started in one field and stayed with it.###you know, they,###i think that's what you just said --n4017fa, you know, having to do more with the size of the school, the environment of the school, uh,###i think that's much more important.
91185:45	but some of the, uh, the small, some of the larger small schools, you know, i guess around three or four thousand students have a, can offer a broader range of curriculums and things,	###yeah.###.### an, and, i mean, choosing from my experience, you know, i thought, you know, my, i know what i want --n40110b a lot more than my parents know what i want --n40113a.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, i don't know,###at the same time, you have --n4013b5 to decide what --n4013c8 is important about the school,###you know, the size of it or,###.###yeah.###i think that's more important --n401544 probably than even the career vocation, because most people change.###.###yeah.###.### i kn-, i know very few people that, uh, --n401673 started in one field and stayed with it.###you know, they,###i think that's what you just said --n4017fa, you know, having to do more with the size of the school, the environment of the school, uh,###i think that's much more important.### i, i think i'd, i'd advise a parent --n401a6d to send a kid to a school --n401a90, though, that --n401aa7 has a number of different types of programs, you know, that, uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer --n401b26,
91286:72	yet, like, say, you know, the university of small town in arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area.	###.###yeah.###.### you have --n4042e6 to really, you have --n404301 to look around at the school.### i, i think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for --n404439.###.###yeah,###yeah.###i think, uh, i would agree with that.###in fact, the thing that, i'm going through the same thing, where in graduate school, i was trying --n40465d to choose.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, a particular institution might be better for my area###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
91333:59	um, you know, when i first was applying for graduate schools --n40590b, i applied to some big programs --n40592e, you know, in this area, like stevens institute of technology, which --n405971 is recognized --n405980 in the northeast as, as, you know, one step below m i t in a sense, you know,	###.###yeah.###.###but i think,###yeah,###see, i'm, i'm at the university of maryland,###so in this, this region, um, though i go to a smaller branch of the university of maryland,###my diploma will still say university of maryland.###.###oh.###.###um, you know, it doesn't, doesn't differentiate on my diploma,###though i would put it on my resume, what program i went to --n4053a8.###but i, i think, you know, i'm actually at a smaller program,###i'm not at the col-, the big college park campus, you know,###that's the big one with the football team.###.###yeah.###.###so i, i think, um, i think you're right, that there's a lot of, there's difficult decisions --n405725 there based on name recognition.
91388:33	so you've really, uh, i guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything.	###um,. i think it depends on if you want --n406725 to be a, if you want a regional job or a national job,###you need that first, job or so out of school, too.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.### i, i guess another thing that --n406977 concerns me is, uh, so many people, it seems like everybody today is still in that mumblex job market###and, uh, um, where was i at --n406b64.###oh, go-, in going to school, you get taught --n406bfd the things you learn --n406c18 in school,###but there is also a whole other dimension, i mean the growing up while you're going --n406d69 to school --n406d78 part.###.###uh-huh,###yeah.###.###and, uh, actually, in the midwest especially, a lot of the schools have, like university of missouri, will have a main campus like columbia, which --n406f13 is big, multi disciplinary,###.###right.###.###and they'll have a satellite campus --n4070be in a, usually in a smaller town that --n4070e9 specializes in the technical field.
91647:32	i think it was, um, oh, some actress reading it.	###.### and, um, and, you know, i just,###but i, as i say, i was pretty much ashamed that i hadn't read something before then.###.###yeah.###.###.###because i, i think i was, i think i read it in college, or had --n40394c to write it, read it in high school or college,###.###uh-huh.###.###but i don't remember it.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###and then when jennie had --n403bc6 to read it at gettysburg --n403be1 and i got her the, i got her someone,###.###uh-huh.###.
91704:14	i'm doing some reviews of books, --n404fb3 just to, what, to sort of recommend to wh-, whether or not a full-scale review should be done --n405032 for the journal,	###uh-huh.###.###when if, if i have long periods of time, like christmas vacation, or, you know, when i know i'm not going --n404694 to be doing anything for a while --n4046b7, um,###.###yeah.###oh, that's what i do --n40488c too.###.###yeah,###and that's about it, because otherwise i'm reading so much for school.### i'm, um, i have just started --n404a09 reading a book.###actually, it's for school,###but it's for, um,###there's a, a literary jour-,###well, not a literary journal,### it's a, it's kind of a journal of, of the history of ideas that --n404ca1's, that --n404cb4's starting --n404cc3 to be published --n404cd6, um, from u t d.###the first issue doesn't come out until next year,###but, um,###.###oh, yeah.###.
91758:36	and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some, aspects of of bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.	###.###yeah.###.###but it's, it was written --n405ab5,###.###yeah.###.###i mean the, the copyright is nineteen ninety-one,###so it's a brand new book.###.###oh, it's a brand new book.###.###yeah,###uh-huh.###.###oh, that, that would be wonderful to read something like that.###.###yeah,###.###.
91758:53	and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some, aspects of of bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.	###.###yeah.###.###but it's, it was written --n405ab5,###.###yeah.###.###i mean the, the copyright is nineteen ninety-one,###so it's a brand new book.###.###oh, it's a brand new book.###.###yeah,###uh-huh.###.###oh, that, that would be wonderful to read something like that.###.###yeah,###.###.
92024:51	every, every family brings a, a dish of some kind,	###.###so they, they take their family.###.###right.###.###but, uh, let's see,###that would make them, grandfather, great grandfather, great great grandfather,###okay,###so it would be the second great grandchild.###and so they,###.###okay,###so this town hall that you meet in --n401776, is that like a, um,###.###well, it's a community center, it's a community hall.###it's, a great big open building that --n401911 has a wonderful kitchen it in,###.###okay.###.###and, uh, you just bring the covered dishes.

92394:53	i mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those english words that you just don't exactly know what they mean --n402e3d --n402e44,	###well, we, um,### let's see,###the only other place i've ever vacationed --n4028a5, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to texoma and things like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then i went to england a few years ago.###.###oh, that's exciting.###.###i was a, student there and spent, um, a semester --n402b1c studying abroad in london.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place###and it's, there's not a language barrier###so you don't,
92531:11	there were some people at the next table who --n4059ec spoke english,	###and then no one knew english in there,###and we were just, finally had --n40551f to break out the phrase book and start --n405546 looking up things.###.###uh-huh.###.###but it was,###.###what did you wind up with --n4056a5..###.###oh, i had fondue.###that was easy to say --n40576f.###.###oh, okay.###.### tried --n405819 to get fondue and white wine,###and that was,###.###uh, uh-huh.###.###we were able --n405914 to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly.
92716:8	just some of the times they're continued --n4029a0,	###sometimes it --n402014's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one.###.###uh-huh.###.### we, we do that sometimes.### i, i guess i'm, i'm not into real heavy stuff.###l a law is about the heaviest thing i watch --n402312.### i, i'll, mostly i'm into it for relaxation,###.###yeah.###.###so i like things like golden girls or cheers###or, uh, monday night is real good with me, you know,###major dad and, and, uh, northern exposure and, and, uh,###oh, what's that one with burt reynolds --n4026d6.###that type of show is what we what, uh, we watch --n402772.###.###uh-huh.###.###we generally just stay on one channel all, for all of monday night, just --n402891 to watch those.
92861:25	and i guess maybe there are some parts of that,	###.###oh.### that, that's all there is --n405753 to it.###.###speakera92-1*t92-1.### and, and, uh, they...###speakerbnan*t92-1.###speakerb92-2*t92-2.###there's not many half hour shows,###speakeranan*t92-2.###speakerb93-1*t93-1.###it seems like that,###speakeranan*t93-1.###speakera93-2*t93-2.###yeah,###speakerbnan*t93-2.###.### it, it, they, they're trying --n405985 to liken the, the father in there of the teenage son --n4059bc to like jackie gleason show. uh, the way he talks to his mother-in-law --n405a03 and so forth,###.###uh-huh.
92888:27	and i like, uh, gymnastics, and some track and field,	###speakerbnan*t96-1.###speakerb96-2*t96-2.###yeah,###no,###speakeranan*t96-2.###.###i watch those if i,###.###but my husband likes --n40623f to watch, um, old movies, especially war movies, or, or, uh, sports, which i'm not,###.###speakerb99-1*t99-1.###oh, see, i like sports.###speakeranan*t99-1.###speakera99-2*t99-2.###no,###i don't.###well, i, i do,###i like ice skating###speakerbnan*t99-2.###.
93005:47	maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, um, they've had some problems with, the recycling on plastic,	###.### he's, he's, he wouldn't let us pull it,###.###how funny.###and i mean, it, it got to the point he was eating a pear here, and he bit into it, and it was just hanging by a thread --n407c75.### and i, and i'd tell him, you know, it's getting ready --n407e1c to fall out,###.###.###and he walked around the house with his fa-, face down toward the floor and his mouth open, --n407f67 hoping it would fall out, because he wouldn't let anybody pull it.###.###.###and he wou-, he wound up --n408126 pull,###.###.###yes, um,### i, i think that plano has really done a fantastic job.###i mean, at least their plans have, are good.###um, how-, however, i was,###.###.
93264:4	some people are compl-, now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked --n4055d8 up at the curbside, you know,	###.###.###yes,###and they appreciate how much it costs --n404e74 --n404e7b to do that.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###that's right.###.###and pretty soon they're, they're figuring out that's not such a bad way to go --n404fc5.###but,###.###that's true,###yeah.###.###.###well, i don't know, you know.### i, i wonder how, how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to, to make this whole thing work. i mean, the extra like washing out bottles and jars, or the extra of actually, uh, making sure that, uh, you take stuff over to, you know --n4052dc,
93424:40	or they will go --n408652 dump it out in the middle of some ocean.	###.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###that's right,###yeah.###.### or, and i don't,###with the mind set of the american public, i think what they will do --n408370 is start --n408383 paying mexico to take our trash. that --n4083aa isn't, that --n4083c1 isn't harmful.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###wow.###that doesn't, wouldn't surprise me.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
93477:92	and then once, about once every three or four years i try --n400c4a to get over to england, because i lived there for a while, some years back.	###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh,###.###your family doesn't live close, then.###.###uh, not anymore.### they, uh, they've been in san diego for the last few years,###and they're moving to florida.###.###okay.###.###and that's one of those things,###you just have --n400a92 to go once a year.###.###yep,###i understand.###.###so, uh, basically it, it sorts out into that,
93765:12	so they took some time off that, uh, they could show us around.	###.###oh, that's interesting.###.### went to panama last august.###.###uh-huh.###.###our son-in-law is from panama.###.###oh.###.###and, uh, we went with our daughter and son-in-law --n406075 to visit his parents, who --n406094 live there.###.###uh-huh.###.###and his father is a, a doctor###and his mother is a kindergarten teacher,###and they took time off,###it was their winter###and they were having a little break,
93923:93	so even though i can look at it as a task, the, you know, i kind of get the, i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by --n401fa1 saying, well, i'm lowering my chance of heart attack, and thus, that type stuff.	###.###and so, it --n401903's interesting that as you get older you begin --n40192e to understand that you need --n401949 to exercise.###.###right.###.###my job at texas instruments, i have --n401a8c to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls, so, that, i don't get any exercise --n401af3 doing that###.###right.###.###and plus there's a build up of stress###.###uh-huh.###.###so i need --n401ce1 to go out and take those walks after dinner,###and i need --n401d9a to go out in the morning and run###or i'll just get nuts###.###right.###.###so that's kind of a motivator,
93980:53	you, you, you take the time --n403072 to relax some how	###.### going to the gym is, is actually something different than, than, like,###oh, and the running,###and i enjoy that too.###.###uh-huh###.###year,###i've been running since high school on track teams and the like,###.###oh.###.###so, running, i, i'm at that point which you probably get to --n402df4 after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more --n402e3b###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right,###.###and you don't think about the pain of it.
94034:23	and i need --n4041e0 to find some place i could go --n404207 and not feel like there's all these people who --n404236 are just huge and hulking that --n404255 are...	### so, so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work the, with my wife, which --n403b77 is nice,###.###yeah.###.###i love her, you know,###i enjoy --n403d2a being with her###.###uh-huh.###.###i guess that's one thing,###but also, uh, that, that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles.###.###right,###that's it,###i do the occasional push up and sit up.###i haven't really brought myself to go to the the gym, because that's very stressful to me,###.###yeah.###.###because i feel, i felt real competitive there,
94131:13	that'll come some day when i,	###.###sleep.###.###if i'm going --n405b83 to walk at night, what do i trade it off for --n405bba.###well, star trek###.###uh-huh.###.###or, you know, it, it, it's always trade offs,###and you actually have --n405ddd to, as you get older you have --n405e08 to really think what --n405e23 can go, and what, --n405e42 to, to, to replace this thing.###.###yeah.###.###it's, i mean, not just exercise, but anything.###it's very hard.###.###right.###.###and, uh, i don't, i don't think you should worry about --n40617f not having a program yet.###.
94182:13	must be some italian spices in there.	###.###okay,###well, i, i, i guess if i was having a dinner party i, depending on the number of people, i might cook a, like a brisket or a roast or a, maybe a chicken dish###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, i guess i usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a, a potato dish,###and we usually serve fresh fruit and, uh, then make a dessert.###.###oh, that sounds good.###.###so that makes,###.###uh, we're not, uh, real wealthy at the moment.###last time i had people over for dinner --n400609 we had lasagna,###and i used my mother's recipe,###i really like it.###it's got, um,###you cook the noodles and make, and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it###and, i'm not sure she even puts,
94280:31	for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some, um, tomato sauce in it,	### trying --n4020a9 to think what else i like --n4020c8 to serve --n4020d7.###my mother likes --n402190 to serve taco grandes.###have you ever had, that.###.###i don't know,###.###.###what that is --n40229e.###no###i don't know what that is --n402311.###.###you take a flour tortilla###and you fry it like a taco shell###.###okay.###.###.###right.###.###and you, uh,
94526:45	and we found that if it's in a certain part of texas, some people come,	###first time,### i, i married into the family,###and the first time i went --n4006c9 was about fifty-seven, i think --n4006ec.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, this one has been well organized###and in fact it used --n400834 to be at lake brownwood,###and now it's lake texoma, because that's more central location for people from oklahoma and texas to come to --n40091b.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###i'm sure location's really important as far as figuring out where one ought --n400a5f to be --n400a6e.###.###very important, because, uh, you'll start --n400b85 losing people if it's too far to go.###.###uh-huh.###we have factions, when it's one part --n400cc2,### we, i have one reunion on my mother's side,
94628:6	and some just come in for saturday	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###but, um, they have various organized,###they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes, uh, to pitch --n40257c,###and they organize a baseball game for the kids###.###uh-huh.###.###and several people bring boats,###and there's a place they, they take the kids up to the lodge and go --n40275a swimming up there in the afternoon --n402779,###so it it's a full day.###.###so there's lots to do --n40292f.###.###some of the people come down on friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend,###.###uh-huh.###.
94633:27	and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see --n402bba all year long except that once a year.	###they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes, uh, to pitch --n40257c,###and they organize a baseball game for the kids###.###uh-huh.###.###and several people bring boats,###and there's a place they, they take the kids up to the lodge and go --n40275a swimming up there in the afternoon --n402779,###so it it's a full day.###.###so there's lots to do --n40292f.###.###some of the people come down on friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend,###.###uh-huh.###.###and some just come in for saturday###.###uh-huh.###.###so, it, uh, has worked out quite well,
94692:14	and choose, some place that everybody's going --n403d43 to like --n403d52 as far as food and all that.	###yeah.###.###and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###we have,###each year, of course, they elect officers of the family reunion###.###uh-huh.###.###and a number of years ago, back in the early eighties, my wife was president.###we discovered how much work it --n403b3b is --n403b46 just to organize --n403b5d and get --n403b6c --n403b73 it together.###and it takes a lot of planning, and assembling of stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###.
94747:14	there have been some really wild shows put on there.	###the show this weekend,###this weekend's going --n404586 to be a rock and roll show###.###oh, boy.###.###my two grandsons and one of their cousins are, are going --n40466d to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know, in jeans and t-shirts and such.###.###oh, what fun.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, it's, uh, it's going --n404861 to be exciting for them, and for us too.###.###uh-huh.###probably lots of laughs.###.###oh, yes,###.###.
94780:11	and, uh some people do	###.###yeah.###.###so, the officer idea is a good idea.###.###yeah,###well we've, uh, had various things --n404f25 over the years, uh, --n404f48 to raise funds for it###.###uh-huh.###.###and again, it's not, it --n40506c's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such,###.###yeah.###.###but, uh they've come up with,###.###uh-huh.###.###they've tried --n405297 passing the hat,###and they've had auctions and various things --n40531c to raise funds,
94784:6	and some people don't.	###.###yeah,###well we've, uh, had various things --n404f25 over the years, uh, --n404f48 to raise funds for it###.###uh-huh.###.###and again, it's not, it --n40506c's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such,###.###yeah.###.###but, uh they've come up with,###.###uh-huh.###.###they've tried --n405297 passing the hat,###and they've had auctions and various things --n40531c to raise funds,###and, uh some people do###.###uh-huh.###.
94879:19	but, you know, some that --n402df2 are um, that, they're, they're not quite the same as the kids that --n402e51 are going to the inner city, uh, you know, public schools.	###but, uh, i just remember --n4020c2 seeing on the news the other night, they had the thing about how catholic schools are doing so much better --n402121###.###uh-huh.###.###i thought, well, you know, of course they're doing better,###and not so much when i was growing up --n40232b, catholic schools are generally considered --n40234a a little bit easier than the public schools,###but, uh, they still had a, a better success rate, simply because they started with a lot better raw material.###i mean everybody that --n402596 went to a catholic school had, uh, at least the parents did, at least, had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it.###.###right,###.###.###right.###.###and i wonder if, not so much that, uh,###.###well, i think it's, like you say, it's, it's the socioeconomic mix### there, you know, the, they're,###you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who --n402ada are basically, uh, that --n402afd might be more well to-, well off, you know, going to a private catholic school or whatever --n402b58, uh,### and, and they're not all that way,
94896:51	it shows, i think it shows that the parents have some, uh, desire for, for the kid to do, do well, you know,	### there, you know, the, they're,###you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who --n402ada are basically, uh, that --n402afd might be more well to-, well off, you know, going to a private catholic school or whatever --n402b58, uh,### and, and they're not all that way,###but, you know, some that --n402df2 are um, that, they're, they're not quite the same as the kids that --n402e51 are going to the inner city, uh, you know, public schools.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###this is interesting because in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a catholic school being a suburban kind of environment,###but, uh, this, this was actually inner city###.###yeah.###.###people were sending,###i mean, just because their kids had the ability and the, and the drive --n4032e9 to do, try and get an education, they didn't send him to a public school, you know,###like you said, you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured --n403513 not to learn --n403526 in instance,###.###yeah,###well, you know, in a lot of cases like that, where, you know, if kids are going to a public parochial school like that, it's, it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education.
94915:24	and i think this is happening some around the country in terms of, um, morals, trying --n404781 to teach the kinds of things that, that --n4047b8 aren't getting taught --n4047cf at home, and, uh, and, and respect for other people.	###well, you know, in a lot of cases like that, where, you know, if kids are going to a public parochial school like that, it's, it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education.### it shows, i think it shows that the parents have some, uh, desire for, for the kid to do, do well, you know,###and that may be passed --n403ad4 on down to the kid as well,###and, uh, maybe they pick up on that.###.###yeah.###.###and then from the other aspect, um, maybe the, uh, school itself has, has, has more emphasis on, uh, --n403c82 trying --n403c8d to do a good job because the classes may be smaller, uh,###they may be able --n403e5c to, to give the resources that --n403e8b's needed --n403e9a to, uh, to do a good job.###.###yeah,###i mean,###and what do you, what would you do --n404071 --n404078 to fix the school systems.###.###uh, that's a tough question how to fix the school system --n404183.###.###yeah,###.###uh, with, uh,###i would try --n404284 to, i guess, to see about getting parents more involved, with, try to, --n4042fb to come up with more ways to do that --n404332. uh, uh, uh, stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students, and, uh, more, more classes that i think that --n4043d5 are,
94976:130	and, um, about, i guess about when the first, when the youngest one was in kindergarten --n400407 i started --n400416 working at a preschool and, uh, you know, doing some work,	###my children as a matter of fact, are all grown now.###so, i am assisting them with their children in their selections,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh, great.###.###so.###.###great,###well my children are grown,###but they're teenagers###.###uh-huh.###.###so i have three children, um, fifteen, ages fifteen, seventeen and twenty###.###uh-huh.###.
95199:151	but when time came --n404c7b to direct their ability to make choices to develop the kinds of things that, that they're going --n404cd6 to need --n404ce5 --n404cec to interact with other people --n404d07 --n404d0e, i felt like i needed some strong influence there.	###.###so i quit --n404820 working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that i could help --n40487f direct their, their learning experiences and their development.###.###oh, you did.###.###.###um.###.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.### i, i felt like that anybody who --n404aad cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them and hold them.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yes,###yes,###.
95345:10	i do some p c stand alone work on it,	###and she said, well, she said, you know, kids do exaggerate,###but she said, let's go ahead and send him another day, or two days,###and i promise you faithfully, i will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what --n407487's happening.###.###oh, good,###.###.###yes,###.###.###so do you have p c --s.###.###i have a personal computer at home.###it's an a t compatible.###i don't use it very much any more.###i used --n4001a3 to use it quite a bit.###.###uh-huh.###.###i also have a p c --n400252 at work that i use --n40026d as a terminal.
95400:23	um, well, i actually do some work, --n4010c5 working at m i t and at nist, national institute of standards and technology in washington,	###.###uh-huh.###.###it's a three eighty-six###.###i'm jealous.###.###and the other is actually a i b m p c compatible,###it's a three eighty-six,###i guess it's twenty-five,###yeah,###three eight six twenty-five c maybe###i don't know,###no###we don't have the mumblex,###mumblex we decided --n400e26 not to get the mumblex which --n400e45 is actually another loaner one --n400e60 too that we picked --n400e77 up for a consulting job that my husband was doing --n400ea6,###and,###.###what kind of consulting do you do --n40103b.###.
95535:14	she told me some of the things you can do --n403dab,	###i can't talk on th-, can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone call.###.###what time is it --n4037ee now where you are --n403805.###.###uh, about twenty after four.###.###so you're an hour ahead of where i am --n403902.###i'm in central central time zone.###.###okay,###yeah###.###.###we're eastern.###and, um, what did, did you ever try --n403aa1 using like prodigy or any of those systems.###.###no,###i haven't done that.###uh, i know someone who --n403c39 has,### and, and she's, uh, very, uh, pleased with it.

95651:89	so, i, i, uh, i, i, i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions,	###.###uh-huh.###.###um, sometimes i get called --n4057b2 late at night at home because there's a production problem,###and that gives me the opportunity to, uh, come in to work and fix it, if i can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter --n405916 while we're on the phone.###.###.###right.###.###um, i also, uh, handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who --n405b0d need --n405b18 to find out something connected,###.###.###what do you think --n400022 about it.###.###well, i, i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that --n4000d3 have happened lately, that i think there are some occupations that they should, such as the health field, the transportation field, uh,###they're already doing it in the armed forces, where they handle weapons and so forth --n400366,###uh, they do it to prisoners###.###yeah.###.
95804:23	there's got --n403631 to be some backup to say that	###you know, so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel --n402d90,### that's, that's just the way it is --n402e66.###.###either just the lucky or the unlucky one, depending on how you look at it --n402f59.###.### i would, i would rather --n40301e have it that way, to know that i was chosen --n403055 at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in because i, i think there's, when you let other employees turn in people --n4030e4,###.###oh, absolutely,###.###.###there are so many people with, with their petty axes to grind --n4033d3###.###right.###.###it could really get out of hand.###.###right.###.###.###so, i, i, i would really rather know, however,
95835:35	but out on the line, they've got people working some serious equipment.	###.###right.###.### i'd just i'd feel really uncomfortable.###.###right.###.###.###right.###i don't know what kind of work you do --n403ccd,###but there, there would be, even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that --n403da8 was that way --n403dbb.###.###yeah,### we have, we have a lot of people who --n403f31 work on the line.###i'm in accounting,###so it wouldn't,###you know they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something,###.###right.###.
95845:124	i, i just think employers have --n404305 to have, especially given today, the drug abuse that --n404340 goes on, i just think employers have --n40436b to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put --n4043b6 at risk --n4043c5. because they're the ones who --n4043e8 are going --n4043f7 to have the lawsuits, the insurance claims, et cetera,	###but there, there would be, even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that --n403da8 was that way --n403dbb.###.###yeah,### we have, we have a lot of people who --n403f31 work on the line.###i'm in accounting,###so it wouldn't,###you know they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something,###.###right.###.###but out on the line, they've got people working some serious equipment.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###so.###.### it's, it's,
95853:38	and, and i'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to, uh, illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse.	###right.###.###but out on the line, they've got people working some serious equipment.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###so.###.### it's, it's,### i, i just think employers have --n404305 to have, especially given today, the drug abuse that --n404340 goes on, i just think employers have --n40436b to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put --n4043b6 at risk --n4043c5. because they're the ones who --n4043e8 are going --n4043f7 to have the lawsuits, the insurance claims, et cetera,###.###put at risk.###.###.###i agree totally.###.###.
95920:91	and, and then they say, well, if you give them the right to do this, then they're going --n4060e9 to take some other right away from you,	###.###uh-huh.###.###however, this isn't a problem that we have --n405a2d either alcohol or drug,###.###right.###.###and so, we, we, in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal --n405b3a.###.###yeah,###that's the way i looked at it --n405c5b.###if i had something to hide --n405cfb, it's one thing,###but i'm,###you know, you know you don't,###so it's not as big a deal,###and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much --n405f08 whether they're really concerned about their rights, or whether they're really concerned about something else.###.###right.###.###.
96000:74	but, uh, i would, i think it would be smart if somebody would keep, uh, some sort of a plan that --n401663 works for them.	###that sounds real similar.###.###so, i think it --n40107f is probably better to have some sort of a, a, at least a record###but my dad was so precise, that, i mean, if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what --n40124e it was spent --n401261.###.###um.###.###and that was put --n4013bf over there###.###oh, my,###yeah.###.###and, i mean, of course, he is from the depression,###and, uh, so, uh, you know, it's his life,###.###yeah.###.###.###sure.###.
96034:46	well, as a matter of fact, uh, my mother was going through some things --n402257 not lon-, not long ago, i guess it has been a couple of years ago, in an old trunk that she had --n4022c6.	###i'm a historian,###and my father had kept them, i think --n401d09, since nineteen twenty-seven### and, uh, but he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi-,###.###my goodness.###.###i could not believe he did that,### but then, so, i took the ones from fifty-two on to the present,###.###oh dear.###.###.###yes.###.###but, to look, to have looked back into the twenties, thirties and forties, it --n40207a would have been fantastic, to see that.###.###oh yes.###.###but, uh,###.
96042:48	i mean it was, it was just almost laughable in some instances that, you know,	###.###oh dear.###.###.###yes.###.###but, to look, to have looked back into the twenties, thirties and forties, it --n40207a would have been fantastic, to see that.###.###oh yes.###.###but, uh,###.###well, as a matter of fact, uh, my mother was going through some things --n402257 not lon-, not long ago, i guess it has been a couple of years ago, in an old trunk that she had --n4022c6.###and she came upon a, a budget book that she had --n4024a2 back in the thirties. uh, when they,###.###uh-huh.###.###it was the late, well###i guess it would have been, i will take that back, it must have been in the forties, because they had been married, uh, probably fifteen years at the time.###and, it --n40282d was just, uh, fascinating to see how little things cost --n402868,
96092:53	well, uh, we have tried --n4036a0 to, uh, instill some, some sense of, uh, of budgeting in our kids,	###.###really.###oh, that is, that is really, really something.###.###oh. but, of course, it's just what the market will bear --n403313.###.###that's true.###.###if people will pay two hundred then why charge ten --n403411.###.###yeah,###.###you know, mumblex,###.### that's, that's right.### that's, exa-, that's just good old economics working.###.###right,###right.###.
96261:16	and i can take some real great tours to europe.	###sure.###.###so uh, it really makes it easier###.###yeah,###that's true.###.###but, uh, well, i have enjoyed --n4062f9 talking with you, jerry.###.###i have enjoyed --n4063a2 talking with you, kathy.###.###and, i, i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life, because that sounds really fascinating to me.###i am interested in that.###.###well, if i had your address, i would send you,###i am also in the travel business,###i do tours###.###oh.###.
96428:11	they have some, but not, not so much.	###.###oh.###.###the beach is really nice, isn't it.###.###yes,### it's, uh, it's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water, and a, lot of nice waves usually, uh,###.###oh.###.###.###sea shells.###.### enough, enough to make it.###i am sorry.###.###sea shells.###.###uh, there's not as many sea shells along there, uh,###that's the only thing that they really do not,
96432:43	um, if you go further down, uh, you will usually find some, but not right in there.	###.###yes,### it's, uh, it's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water, and a, lot of nice waves usually, uh,###.###oh.###.###.###sea shells.###.### enough, enough to make it.###i am sorry.###.###sea shells.###.###uh, there's not as many sea shells along there, uh,###that's the only thing that they really do not,###they have some, but not, not so much.###.###yeah.###.
96656:11	we have some engineers that --n401137 still,	###.###but we have got more women in it now.###.###yes,###yes.###.###there's a lot of us in it.###.###yes, uh,###.###so.###.###yes###in years past, i know --n400f37, in fact, even, even the word drafter has changed,###.###uh.###.###because, it used --n401068 to be they were draftsman.###.###uh-huh,
96724:27	so, there are some, some strides --n4024db to be made --n4024ee there.	###.### and, and i think that, uh, you know, the one thing that i have seen --n401da2 is that more and more women are getting into management,###.###.###but i think they have got a long way --n401f2d to go --n401f3c.###.###oh, definitely,###definitely.###.###there was something on t v --n402049 the other day that --n402060 said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of, uh, chairmen of the board, chair-, chair persons, uh, if you sa-, if you will, of the board are women in this country.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i thought that, you know, that's pretty si-, a pretty significantly small number.###.###yeah.###.
96743:132	and, uh, uh, i guess my, i, uh, the one, my one bad thing is that i am, that i wish my mother had had some of those opportunities, because, i think she would have really, she rea-, would have succeeded in a lot of ways, that men, that women were not able --n402b2d to succeed --n402b3c, in her, generation.	###.###so, there are some, some strides --n4024db to be made --n4024ee there.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###but, uh, i do not know,### i, i think we have come a long way, actually, when i think about, you know, when things were like even, when i, you know, just when i was in high school --n4026f5 --n4026fc, and how it is --n402717 now for girls --n40272a.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###.
96775:40	so, she is pretty much, although there were some other women in her class, she was, you know, uh, one of the minorities,	###uh-huh.###.###.###exactly.###.###so, anyway. do you have children.###.###no,###huh-uh.###.###i was going --n403008 to say do you have daughters.###that's always a good question.###.###do you.###.###yes.###in fact, i have a daughter who --n403154 is in a, a, who --n40317b just graduated in civil engineering, from college.###.###oh, wonderful.###.
96866:33	and so. but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of --n405083 doing the job.	###uh-huh.###.### the, uh, the, uh, the role of women in combat roles during the war.###.###oh, oh.###.###because, i know that there, now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###and the only, uh, branch in the armed fo-, services that --n404ce3 seems willing --n404cf2 to do that is the air force.###and, uh, i spoke because women were filing, flying missions into, you know, for whatever reason, into, uh, in the persian gulf war.###.###huh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.
96870:36	they were. i was listening to some of the comments on ra-, television --n405219 the other day, uh, about it,	###oh, oh.###.###because, i know that there, now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###and the only, uh, branch in the armed fo-, services that --n404ce3 seems willing --n404cf2 to do that is the air force.###and, uh, i spoke because women were filing, flying missions into, you know, for whatever reason, into, uh, in the persian gulf war.###.###huh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.### and so. but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of --n405083 doing the job.###.###.###it was real interesting,
96882:42	but i just would rather have, uh, a man --n4057e2 doing some of these jobs than a woman.	###.###yeah,###yeah.###.### and so. but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of --n405083 doing the job.###.###.###it was real interesting,### they were. i was listening to some of the comments on ra-, television --n405219 the other day, uh, about it,###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, one of, one of the men who --n40539f was a,###i do not know if he was a general or, you know, what his rank was --n4054b5,###very high.###.###uh-huh.###.###he said, mumblex it's just a personal thing with me.###i mean, i can not be real, you know i can not tell you why i feel this way --n4056a9,
96886:11	there's some men out there that --n405a58 are more feminine than most women.	### and so. but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of --n405083 doing the job.###.###.###it was real interesting,### they were. i was listening to some of the comments on ra-, television --n405219 the other day, uh, about it,###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, one of, one of the men who --n40539f was a,###i do not know if he was a general or, you know, what his rank was --n4054b5,###very high.###.###uh-huh.###.###he said, mumblex it's just a personal thing with me.###i mean, i can not be real, you know i can not tell you why i feel this way --n4056a9,###but i just would rather have, uh, a man --n4057e2 doing some of these jobs than a woman.###i thought, well, at least he was honest.###but, that does not sit very well with a lot of folks, i am sure --n40598f.###.
97004:103	because, uh, i, i guess i placed all but one or two of my calls. and, uh, only because i going --n407510 to make some money,	###that's good.###.###i personally have not made any calls yet, myself,### i, just, it never crosses my mind.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###well,###.###but i enjoy --n407372 receiving them.###.###yeah,###well, that's good,###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###that's good,
97106:13	it's, some good, some bad, uh,	###you know, let the world train them what --n40069b to do --n4006aa.###but characteristically, you know, the women are trained, or have been in the past trained --n40079c in the home.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i really would be at a loss to, --n4008ac to raise and train a girl.###i think i would.###.###yeah,###it's,###well even, even raising boys today is different though, because, they are expected --n400a70 to do so much more than they used --n400a97 to.###.###oh, sure.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, used --n400c53 to be they would just go off to work and come home,###and you know, everything was done.###and it, it's a different world.
97106:20	it's, some good, some bad, uh,	###you know, let the world train them what --n40069b to do --n4006aa.###but characteristically, you know, the women are trained, or have been in the past trained --n40079c in the home.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i really would be at a loss to, --n4008ac to raise and train a girl.###i think i would.###.###yeah,###it's,###well even, even raising boys today is different though, because, they are expected --n400a70 to do so much more than they used --n400a97 to.###.###oh, sure.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, used --n400c53 to be they would just go off to work and come home,###and you know, everything was done.###and it, it's a different world.
97229:18	or we really do develop some health problems.	###right.###.###there's not a lot of physical labor, because, there are,###.###right.###.###.###you are not beating rugs,###.###uh-huh.###.###you are not, right, doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing.###.###right.###.###.###and in that respect, we have --n4025e6 to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion,###.###uh-huh.###.
97320:78	i was rea-, i was really looking forward to summer, thinking oh, we are going --n403e7b to have some time off.	###they need --n403895 to be busy###and they need --n4038fc to be active.###and i fought all of those things,###i said if those boys want --n4039e1 to be involved --n4039f4 in that they will come to me###and they will say mom this is important to me,###i want --n403b6e to do it,###.###right,###right.###.###otherwise, i will guard their ability to have quiet time.###.###you know, it's funny,###.###i refused --n403d16 to cram their lives full.###.###yeah,###yeah.###it's funny,###it's funny
97543:11	i have some friends that --n4003df have children,	###.### do you work with, do you work around children when you work --n4000c4.###.###no,###no,###not at all.###i work with computers.###.###with computers.###.###yep,###they what,###.###okay,###do you ha-,###.###one thing i,###.###but you have friends that --n400355 have children.###.
97584:19	well hopefully i can do some consulting work at home.	###no,###not at all,###in fact my situation is a little bit strange,###i was, uh, a student for many years, and then graduated and went and worked in france for awhile.###and, i, have just come back and was doing consulting work.###.###oh.###.###.###oh, my.###.###so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now.###.###a sabbatical.###.###uh, and, and i might,###.###well i hope you can stay as long as possible with it.###.###yeah,
97677:6	and some were just different objects that --n402eca have, had a definite purpose for kids, you know,	###right.###.###and, uh,###.###our oldest grandson, when he was eighteen months old --n40259a went into a, a montessori, day care system.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they took infants starting at six weeks,###and they have a program, uh, in, that --n40273f was devised --n40274e by this montessori person### and, uh, and a certain type of stimulations###and there's times of day that even when the child is awake --n4028ee that they, that they lay quietly and look at certain things###they keep, deliberately keep the room not real bright.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and, uh, they have different things they will, they will put them down on the floor --n402b64,###and of course, they never have more than like five,### and, and they will put them down on the floor###and they will have on-, i think one of them was a little mirror
97813:26	and, you know, maybe do some free lance type work at home.	###incredible,###but you know, since this is,###.###speakera116-1*t116-1.###people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids.###speakerbnan*t116-1.###speakerb116-2*t116-2.###uh-huh,###speakeranan*t116-2.###.###uh-huh.###and, you know, i just find that incredible.###and my sister-in-law is going --n40567a to have a baby very, very soon###.###and she is intending --n40571d to stay home with the baby.###.###speakerb119-1*t119-1.###oh.###speakeranan*t119-1.###speakera119-2*t119-2.

97989:5	some of the changing roles of women in that respect, i have been a product of --n4013a2.	###.###uh, it was always my mother's fault,###she was not, uh, sufficient, you know,###she just was not good enough.###what --n400ee7 was wrong with her, was she not attractive enough,###did she not take good enough care of her man --n400fc7 to keep his interest.###it was that kind of an attitude.###.###yeah,### that, that's too bad.###.###so, uh,###yeah###it was too bad,###it was really rough.###.###um, um, that's sad.###it really is.###.###uh, so, you know, that's so changing,
98248:22	and i think there are some people that --n406860 have done that,	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###it's true.###.###and, uh, that's really the, the divine answer, and, and the right answer.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, uh, uh, that would be a beautiful relationship.###.###uh-huh,###it would be.###.
98822:22	well, th-, some of that,	###well i think you know, they did that in alaska. that, that actually, alaska just recently legalized marijuana.###.###uh, uh-huh.###.###.###but i never, i never heard results or anything like that,###so i never, you know,###plus, that's such a, that's not a true, uh, you know, it really couldn't be a good test because alaska's so different than every other part of the country.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, so that, but that was interesting, you know,### i, i don't,###crime is one of those things that --n404ad6's, uh,### i, i don't know, you know,###the drug culture,### the, uh, the, uh, you know,### i, i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things, not thinking anything wrong with it.###.###yeah,

99158:38	but, you don't know, uh, i guess at some of the other schools you go to --n4014f1 unless you've been there.	###well, i bet you're, you're, you may dress differently, then, for that.###.###right.###i,###well, not really.### i've got the, every day i've got --n400999 to, uh, read to kindergartners,###so i'm going --n400a96 to be down on the floor with them.###i've got about forty kindergartners i'm going --n400b67 to be doing, working with --n400b86 every day for, uh, you know, a half hour.###so i'll be, i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do because i'm, i'm, if i'm going --n400d83 to be down on the floor --n400da2 messing with them, i'm not going --n400dc9 to wear nylons and, you know nice nylons and dresses.###.###well, what i wear --n40109c sometimes depends on, on how cold i think the school might be --n4010db or what room i might be in --n4010fe since i'm a sub, and have different rooms to go to --n401141. and always carry a sweater.###.###.###right.###.###.###well, of course, you've been at clark enough that you know it's always cold.###.###yes.###.
99168:73	and it's, it --n4017af's interesting to notice when you go to different schools --n4017e2 that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual, uh,	###well, what i wear --n40109c sometimes depends on, on how cold i think the school might be --n4010db or what room i might be in --n4010fe since i'm a sub, and have different rooms to go to --n401141. and always carry a sweater.###.###.###right.###.###.###well, of course, you've been at clark enough that you know it's always cold.###.###yes.###.###but, you don't know, uh, i guess at some of the other schools you go to --n4014f1 unless you've been there.###.###no,###you try --n401634 to layer, so you can add or, or or take off.###.### subtract.###.###.###right.###.
99170:29	i, i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools.	###.###right.###.###.###well, of course, you've been at clark enough that you know it's always cold.###.###yes.###.###but, you don't know, uh, i guess at some of the other schools you go to --n4014f1 unless you've been there.###.###no,###you try --n401634 to layer, so you can add or, or or take off.###.### subtract.###.###.###right.###.###and it's, it --n4017af's interesting to notice when you go to different schools --n4017e2 that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual, uh,###.
99197:51	and one might be a hat day where you have --n4028c4 to come up with some sort of hat --n4028eb.	### and, and i said, well, you know, that was okay.###and i'm,###basically, i just, you know, i wear slacks year round except every, about once a week i try --n401ede to wear a skirt.### and, and in the winter, you know, i just add a, maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer. and add a heavier jacket or, you know, wear jackets more --n4020d7 in the winter than i do in the summer.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's about,### i don't, i don't really work in a profession that --n402369 requires that i wear a business suit and, you know, look really,###.###right,###and, well, for me sometimes, they even have dress up days###or they, you know, have, have spirit week that, that you wear your different outfits --n402605###.###yeah.###.###and you have --n402722 to have the color for that particular school if you, if you choose --n402761 to participate in spirit week.###.###right.###.
99236:8	because some of the teachers i know --n4036ec wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had --n40373f dry cleaned --n40374e so they have got the crease	###right,###it might be thursday for the high schools###and it may be friday for the senior high schools.###.###right,###right.###so that would kind of give you a, a clue, i guess --n403084### and, and sometimes you get the long term stuff###so you're aware --n4031cb ahead of time of what --n4031e6's going on.###.###yeah.###.###that,###so that's,###and i don't know, you know,### i, i think about, well, the dress code they have --n4033b3 for the kids, you know.###are###they put one on the parents, or the teachers and say they have --n40350a to, the men have --n403525 to wear ties###and there can be no blue jeans worn###and,
99247:72	i think the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, i think.	###.###that,###so that's,###and i don't know, you know,### i, i think about, well, the dress code they have --n4033b3 for the kids, you know.###are###they put one on the parents, or the teachers and say they have --n40350a to, the men have --n403525 to wear ties###and there can be no blue jeans worn###and,###because some of the teachers i know --n4036ec wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had --n40373f dry cleaned --n40374e so they have got the crease###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, you know, they'll wear it with a nice top.### and, and, uh, i don't know that that looks that bad.###but, if you're going --n403a92 to tell the kids they c-, have --n403abd to dress up, i guess you can tell the teachers that, too.###.###yeah,### it, it,###i see that the,
99256:22	and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools, like history at clark, they're all pretty fancy.	###because some of the teachers i know --n4036ec wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had --n40373f dry cleaned --n40374e so they have got the crease###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, you know, they'll wear it with a nice top.### and, and, uh, i don't know that that looks that bad.###but, if you're going --n403a92 to tell the kids they c-, have --n403abd to dress up, i guess you can tell the teachers that, too.###.###yeah,### it, it,###i see that the,###i think the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, i think.###.###uh-huh.###.###but it, i think it varies, it, it just so much.### anything, anything can go.###.###uh-huh.###.

99291:5	some of those male coaches, that might really,	###.###right.###.###right.###.###and so you try --n4045ce to maybe follow those if you know you're going there,###you don't want --n4046cd to dress too tacky because you're going --n4046f4 to be in the same room with them.###.###right.###well, and you always,###course, it's a standing joke, you know, when the, when the men come in in a, a tie and a suit coat --n4048dc, you say, you know, what, have you got a job interview today###or, there, there's, there's usually, yeah, there's usually something going on that, that, uh, and --n404b9b would, would, uh, cause that to happen###.###or you're going --n404dcf to be observed --n404de2.###.###.###yeah.###.###and i, i don't know how a coach --n404e9b would feel if, that --n404ec2 teaches health or eng-, you know, english, or whatever --n404ef9 that they had --n404f0c to wear a tie.###i,
99355:10	well, some of them, yes they do	###yeah.###.###you know, so he just left warm-ups on,### but, but, uh, no,###i think, really probably, they could, they could, uh, really,###and i don't know if, if they put, make uniforms the thing for the kids,###i guess the teachers will have --n4060c5 to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top###and,###.###i don't think we'll ever get to that.###.###you don't think so.###.###no,###i don't think.###i think we're going the opposite direction.###it's the parochial schools that i guess many ti-,###they've had uniforms for years,###i r-, don't really know if they still do.###.
99356:32	and, and it's not at some of the private schools,	###.###you know, so he just left warm-ups on,### but, but, uh, no,###i think, really probably, they could, they could, uh, really,###and i don't know if, if they put, make uniforms the thing for the kids,###i guess the teachers will have --n4060c5 to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top###and,###.###i don't think we'll ever get to that.###.###you don't think so.###.###no,###i don't think.###i think we're going the opposite direction.###it's the parochial schools that i guess many ti-,###they've had uniforms for years,###i r-, don't really know if they still do.###.###well, some of them, yes they do
99548:21	uh, and so that was some of,	###.###and i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in biology###and i also wanted --n40229d to spend one year --n4022b4 studying in europe.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i had had an a f s student from germany live with us our senior year###.###oh, how exciting.###.###and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing###and i ended up --n40251b majoring in french.###one of the reasons i picked the school --n4025ad was because they had a strong science department.###they also had a strong language department###and i'd always loved --n4026f2 working with children.###uh, and i found that i couldn't fit everything in,###but because i had had a fair amount of french --n402834 going in i was able --n40284f to do my year's study in france and able --n40287e to take a lot of the other courses that --n4028a9 interested me.###.###uh-huh.###.
99608:4	some schools i know --n4041d4 give, uh, oh,	###but that was, that was my only option.### i, i mean, i just really couldn't look at anything else.###that was the one and only thing i could really afford --n403828 other than a jun-, you know, a junior college, which i didn't want --n403873 to do --n403882.###so that's how, you know, my decision was made --n403a13 --n403a1a.###but, uh,###.###well, th-, that's certainly,###uh, especially today with the cost of college.###i mean that is a, a major, uh, consideration###and i do feel fortunate that texas has so many good schools.###and even though baylor, uh,###.###yes.###.###and when you mentioned that --n403dd2, we, we have friends who --n403df5 have children --n403e04 there who --n403e13 just love it.###and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are###and it is a smaller size###and, uh, i do feel like there are a lot of options.### it's, it's,###but, i had been hoping
99637:89	and i'm, you know, showing them if you're strong in math and science, kiddos, this is one area where women can make some decent money --n404e84. you know.	###and we keep --n404542 encouraging him to keep an open mind.###.###huh.###.###does your daughter know what she'd like --n40460f to do --n40461e.###.###oh, she, she has, uh, you know, interests that --n4046e2 are just, you know, going in all directions.###.###yeah.###.###uh, what she talks about --n404852 a lot is theater which i think --n404879 is,###okay bethany, let's be real.###uh, she really is, is pretty unfocussed at this point.###and, i don't know,###she's taken a lot of french,###and she may end up --n404b50 doing something with that.###and i am a single mom,###so i've been,###and i made the mistake of --n404c80 dropping out of college --n404c97 to get married.###so i'm trying --n404d5a to have my children not make the same mistake.
99651:29	well, it sounds like he's got some really, you know, good strong ideas of what he wants --n405390 to do --n40539f.	###she's taken a lot of french,###and she may end up --n404b50 doing something with that.###and i am a single mom,###so i've been,###and i made the mistake of --n404c80 dropping out of college --n404c97 to get married.###so i'm trying --n404d5a to have my children not make the same mistake.###and i'm, you know, showing them if you're strong in math and science, kiddos, this is one area where women can make some decent money --n404e84. you know.###.###yes.###.###i mean, i'm kind of really putting the practical application, you know, and, and saying, yet, do something that you enjoy --n405070.###.###uh-huh.###.###by all means, go --n4051df get that piece of paper, you know.###do you just have one son.###.###yes.###.###i see.
99740:45	you know, and here it was like, pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime	###i mean it was great after growing up in michigan### and not, and al-, you know, every day was cloudy,###almost every day was cloudy###and i, you sort of forget how much it did rain --n40164c###and coming here###and then it didn't rain,###it was just wonderful.###.###well, yeah,###see i, i lived in, uh, ohio mainly.###i lived in, uh, pontiac just a little while before i came down here###.###oh, yeah.###.###and, you know, so many times when you were trying --n4019cf to schedule outdoor activities --n4019e6, you just never knew if it was going --n401a11 to be a go or not because of the weather.###it might rain on your little parade.###.###that's right,###that's right.###.
99831:29	that's enough to, uh, do some boating	###okay,###sort of.###.###i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes.###it was real close to where i worked --n403278.###it was only like four miles to work###and it --n40335f was wonderful being on the lake like that.###you know, in the summer, you feel like you're, you know, on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake###and everybody's, you know, out enjoying the water and such,###and, uh, in the winter time the lakes froze over,###you could still kind of go --n4036cf sledding and such out there###but i thought it --n403776 was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes.###there's lots of really small ones out there.###.###yeah.###.###you know, like maybe a mile, two long.###.###yeah.###.
99947:44	so but, uh, you know, we probably did some ice skating on it,	###speakera82-1*t82-1.###so, uh, it was nice.###speakerbnan*t82-1.###speakerb82-2*t82-2.###uh-huh,###speakeranan*t82-2.###.###uh-huh.###i always tell people that in the winter we use, we used --n405000 to, uh,###.###speakera84-1*t84-1.###my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on, you know, make a pond in the backyard for us.###speakerbnan*t84-1.###speakerb84-2*t84-2.###oh, yeah,###speakeranan*t84-2.###speakerb85-1*t85-1.###yeah.###speakeranan*t85-1.###speakera85-2*t85-2.
99956:17	christmas time, uh, some of our relatives would come up from alabama,	###.###speakera84-1*t84-1.###my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on, you know, make a pond in the backyard for us.###speakerbnan*t84-1.###speakerb84-2*t84-2.###oh, yeah,###speakeranan*t84-2.###speakerb85-1*t85-1.###yeah.###speakeranan*t85-1.###speakera85-2*t85-2.### so but, uh, you know, we probably did some ice skating on it,###but then it chipped, chipped###and, you know, it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven###speakerbnan*t85-2.###.###so,###yeah,###yeah.###we used --n4054f9 to have a
100548:24	her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in --n40250d.	###and the portions,###people don't want --n401e78 to try --n401e87 to figure out little bitty individual meals.###i do that right now,###.###yeah.###.###and i'm not near nursing home age.###.###although they've got, uh, meals on wheels, which i understand --n40203f is a really good, you know, way to handle that so that at least they eat --n402096.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###so as a family you all just visited nursing homes###or probably in college station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.###.###no,###i don't think there was. um,###i know a little bit more from a, a co-worker.
100571:7	and some of them, i think --n402e67 unconsciously do it, you know, as a just, you know, half seni-,	###.###um, she was ambulatory###and so there was a lesser care.###uh, then she got, uh, uh, hip broken --n4026cb###and then, uh, she wasn't as ambulatory###so they were almost, you know, to the point of --n4027e1 saying she can't be here anymore.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, i remember from her checking around, she ended up --n402919 staying at the arkansas house i think --n402940 out in arlington, something like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that --n402afe share uh, a, uh, bathroom.###all of them all seem --n402c2d to say that people there are going --n402c50 to steal their items.###.###oh yeah.###that's a given.###.###they're always saying that somebody's going --n402db6 to,
100584:49	you know, go to the dining room and, and eat some good meals.	###and, uh, you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that --n402afe share uh, a, uh, bathroom.###all of them all seem --n402c2d to say that people there are going --n402c50 to steal their items.###.###oh yeah.###that's a given.###.###they're always saying that somebody's going --n402db6 to,###and some of them, i think --n402e67 unconsciously do it, you know, as a just, you know, half seni-,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###and sometimes the, the help there does it, i think --n402ff4.###.###uh. so, they, they, uh, don't have too many facilities it seems --n4030ed for their personal items.###very limited space waste###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, at least they all seem --n40324f to have, uh, you know, people that --n40327e monitor their, uh, medication intake and dining facilities,
100603:25	usually there has --n4039ac to be some wealth involved, which --n4039d3 is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money	###but, um, at least they all seem --n40324f to have, uh, you know, people that --n40327e monitor their, uh, medication intake and dining facilities,###you know, go to the dining room and, and eat some good meals.###.###uh-huh.###.###i know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in --n4034e2,###i mean, very antisocial.###maybe it --n4035c7 takes a while for them to say, okay, well i'll be with other people###but,###.###adapt.###.###yeah,###i don't understand that, they, they don't want --n40374e to be with anybody else.###.###yeah.###.###.### i, as i think i mentioned, i was in the trust business###and i've seen so many elderly people.
100604:40	but the, the places like presbyterian village and some of the, the retirement places where, where they have different levels of care --n403cab seems --n403cb6 to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.	###you know, go to the dining room and, and eat some good meals.###.###uh-huh.###.###i know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in --n4034e2,###i mean, very antisocial.###maybe it --n4035c7 takes a while for them to say, okay, well i'll be with other people###but,###.###adapt.###.###yeah,###i don't understand that, they, they don't want --n40374e to be with anybody else.###.###yeah.###.###.### i, as i think i mentioned, i was in the trust business###and i've seen so many elderly people.###usually there has --n4039ac to be some wealth involved, which --n4039d3 is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money
100784:45	and, uh, i had opportunities in high school, to work in some programs, um	###no.###.###no.###okay.###because i, i didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt --n40020a.###.###yeah.###.###um, what do you think --n400319 about the proposal that all young americans should spend a year or two,###.###i think it's a good idea.###i think everybody should, should, uh, put in their time so to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the good of themselves.###.###yeah.###.###i think it's, uh,###would every-, everyone grow up and mature and, and realize what this country's all about --n40078d.###.###i just, um,###i guess that's mumblex, my, that's something that my family has always believed strongly in --n40090b,
100820:27	um, but i do know through some organized groups like scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities.	###.###yeah.###.###.###really.###yeah,###i think that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used --n40110f to go through --n401122, you know,###.###yeah.###.### they, just, they were, they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, i'm not sure they really do --n401374.###.###yes.###.###.###yeah.###well, i think sometimes through groups and organizations, um,### my first, when i first thought of it --n401657, i thought it, uh, when they asked the question --n40169e i thought, well that sounds wonderful.###and then, i wondered if people were unwilling### but, but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think it would stay negative very long.
100889:88	and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back --n402f62. um, if we've lost some of that	###.###.###gosh,###i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area###but you're right.###yeah.###i grew up in a real small town in florida.###.###oh.###.###i mean a real small town.###and, uh, i think it was just mumblex,###of course it was back in the, in the fifties###and i think it was real prevalent back then.### i mumblex, i think people thought more --n402cd1 of others than they do now. you know, as far as --n402d0c doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it.###.###yeah.###.###.###well,
100975:27	i'm glad that there are still some areas that, that --n405515 get the youth involved --n40552c in that sort of thing.	###.###um, and it is, it's, uh,###and they've also see that there's, there's a different way of life and those families are really close.###some of the things, that we talked about --n404f56 that --n404f61 were common in the fifties are still there###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it really,###every youth that --n4050d3's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed --n40510a###and it's changed their perspective.### and, and that's just the t-, two weeks during, during the summer.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, if two weeks, uh, could have that kind of effect i would think, uh,###.###well, that's, that's great.###.###.
101025:37	but from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems, uh, with dropouts.	###thanks.###.###okay.###.###bye,###bye.###.###bye.###.###.###okay,###i guess we're supposed --n400044 to discuss the, uh, school system.###that shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us. right.###.###no.###as many years as we've been involved --n4001f0 in one.###i really feel fortunate in that there, even though there are problems, they're not a lot of problems where i teach --n4002d5.###.###right.###.
101121:88	and schools now are supposed --n4023d1 to solve social problems, uh, mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try --n402424 to provide them with some security.	###.###they don't know what to expect --n401f87 at home.###they don't feel secure there,###they don't know what --n402081's going --n402090 to happen just out front of their apartment complex.###.###right.###.###for example that child that --n4021a4 was shot --n4021b3.###.###right.###.###uh, how can they concentrate on schooling --n402268.###i agree with you,###.###right.###.###i think that's the main problem.###.###yeah.###.
101243:85	and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing, you know, --n404d2c to work and have, uh, some ability.	###right.###.###there will be a lot of people who --n40489e will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world where they don't try --n4048f1 to educate everyone --n404904.###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's one of the things that we do --n404a9f.###we try --n404b2d to educate everyone.###.###that's right.###that's right.###.###we're the only country in the world that --n404c27 does.###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.
101449:50	this is something that --n4021b4 ought --n4021bf to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff they do --n402202.	###uh-huh.###yeah,###that is, uh, a big drawback i think --n401b6c in that, in the, uh, public schools out here. you know, to,###.###uh-huh.###.###you're lucky --n401cf8 to have an art teacher###and if you do you get them once a week or something, you know.###.###or pay for it after school.###our emily's in the third grade over at huffman###and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take french and music and art --n401f6f###and you know, i willingly did it###.###oh is that right.###i had no idea.###.###but i thought, this makes me angry.###.###.
101464:11	so, in some ways i think --n40281d the, the day schools do serve those purposes.	###i had no idea.###.###but i thought, this makes me angry.###.###.###this is something that --n4021b4 ought --n4021bf to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff they do --n402202.###.###oh my goodness.###.###.###and with our budget cuts, i'm sure that's not going to not going --n402385 to change anytime soon.###.###yeah.###.###.### well that's the only way they're. yeah, well, that's the only way they're going --n4024fd to be able --n402510 to do it --n402523.###and parents who --n402696 really want their kids to have any humanities are going --n4026c5 to have --n4026d4 to do that.###.###oh my goodness.###.
101565:16	um, it's some kind of advisory board --n403fa8 they've put --n403fbf together for parents and children	###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###so,###.###i have, uh,###.###i just can not fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center.###.###uh-huh.###i was just listening to a program this morning,###oh well, i guess it was on the home show,###but they were talking about, uh, a new, uh,,###oh i can't even think of the name of it.###i was halfway listening while i was painting.###.###uh-huh.###.
102005:100	it, it's, as much as you want, you know torn up and, and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery	###uh-huh.###.###and it's rice and, mumblex,###when i do recipes --n404268 i just throw stuff in.### i don't, i'm not real good about measuring###.###yeah.###.###because i just,###i do it to taste.###.###uh-huh.###sure.###.###and,###.###sometimes those are the best ones,###.###well yeah,###but it, it's like, it's just chicken,
102016:6	and some hard-boiled eggs.	###uh-huh.###sure.###.###and,###.###sometimes those are the best ones,###.###well yeah,###but it, it's like, it's just chicken,### it, it's, as much as you want, you know torn up and, and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and that's it,
102202:14	i've had some from plano, too.	###.###.###hello.###.###hello.###my name is nola.###i'm in plano, texas.###.###hi nola,###i'm steve.###i'm in dallas, texas.###.###not too far away.###.###no,###that's unusual.###.###.### seems like usually,###.
102431:45	i know they do do some, they do have some classes --n4052b2 --n4052b9 in, um, high schools and things for kids --n4052ec to, uh, give them an idea of what family life is like --n40532b and the, uh, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing	###.###well, i think it's going --n404d90 to, change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else.###.###when they're young --n404ea0,###.###.###yeah.###.###the home is the base,###it's the basic unit.###and that's the, where it all starts --n404fbf###and if we don't start --n40505f making changes in the homes###and maybe part of that is educating parents better.###.###yeah.###.###and educating, uh, you know,###.### changing people's expectations.###.
102546:21	and i'm not fond of some of those things	###and we went in there, actually we went in there for lunch one day.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, their pastas were great.###.### tha-, that's one of the things, a good pasta means a lot to me.### i, i like different kinds of food.###so, when we go out --n4023ec, i'm always looking for something other than the standard menu, even if, it's a mexican restaurant, like something other than, uh, you know the standard tacos, enchiladas, tamales and fajitas now.###.###.###you're brave.###.###yes,###yes###and once in a while things backfire.###i mean, we've gone for romanian food and lebanese food, and things like that###.###oh, god.###.
102781:19	i went to dinner with some friends last weekend	###.###it was really good.###we###.###oh.###.###uh, jeff wariner just got out of the hospital###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, jeff and deeanna --n4004e5 went and another friend in the neighborhood,###and, uh, we all liked it.###we had both moms and, uh, fifteen year olds and a twelve year old###and everyone enjoyed it.###.###oh, my goodness.###.###and, uh,###.###oh, well i am just dying --n40075d to see it.
102998:7	but some of the different things we're doing --n4055a5, uh there's just not a time, enough time to do it all --n4055f0	###.###no,###that was one, uh, jay got --n404bf0 to see --n404bff with a friend###and so i###.###uh.###.###and to try and, uh, try and find time it --n404d33's hard, uh, with jim's schedule, too, just to get a time that we can both go --n404d96.###.###oh yeah.###.###and, uh, i'm holding out for city slickers for the two of us because, uh, we had friends that --n404f9c went --n404fa7 to see that and said, you know, it's just perfect for our age group###.###uh-huh.###.### and because i think he, he needs a comedy, too.###uh, and that --n4052a7's what he would have liked --n4052c6 to have seen --n4052d9 regarding henry, too,###but knew that, uh,### we've, we've got a lot of company this summer, which --n40544e is wonderful.###we're really enjoying it
103093:27	well, we do s-, some dining out.	###.###and we went to the,###.###.###okay.###.###hi, nancy.###.###h-,###.###well, do you do a lot of dining out.###.###no, um,###we don't although we enjoy it.###um, we do it more when we have company come --n4001e8.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, what about you.###.
103194:37	my in-laws also enjoy prime rib, when they've had some of their specials on sunday, monday, or tuesday night --n4024fe	###.###uh-huh.###.###and, my husband really likes their ribs.###so it's hysterical.###we go in###and we sit there for an hour --n40201a waiting --n402025 to get in###and then we get there###and we don't even look at the menu.###.###you know right away what you want --n402192.###.###i know right away what we, what we want --n402222.###yeah.###yeah.###.###well, we really enjoy prime rib, too,###and, uh, actually the, the steak and ale out here, uh, we've gone to --n4023c6, uh,###.###.
103477:18	but i know in some areas, it's really, it, it really is bad.	###.###.###okay.###um,###.###where do you live --n400053.###.###in plano.###.###in plano.###.###yes.###where do you live --n400112.###.###in dallas.###.###oh, okay.###.###uh, the air pollution isn't too bad in our area.###so, we're very fortunate
103563:4	some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become, uh, bomb quality.	###well, it was actually, it was put --n4020c9 on by the power companies and, about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was --n402128, and there wasn't --n402143 from various kinds of, of energy.###and, uh, at that point in time, one person that --n40236d was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain###and it was kind of pooh-poohed --n402480, you know.###oh, you're making a mountain out of a molehill, kind of thing.###and it's turned out that, that's been very true, what he was forecasting --n402602 about the accumulation of, of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do --n402659 to foliage.###so, it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course --n402833.###now, a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear.###uh, i'm not afraid of nuclear, --n40299d having had that course because of how the nuclear that, uh, they use --n4029e0 is not bomb quality --n4029f7,###and, we're so strict with all our controls --n402b38 in the united states. the chances of, of an accident are slight,###and, it doesn't pollute the air at all.###it --n402cde's safer --n402ced to be around a nuclear plant then it --n402d18 is to be around a coal plant.###many more deaths --n402e4c have occurred in --n402e5f and dealing with --n402e76 coal plants then ever around nuclear plants.###it's kind of funny because people are just petrified, at least some are, at the thought of nuclear.###.###yes.###.###so, i don't know.###in europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power###and they recycle the fuel###and then instead of, of,
103574:12	my line gets some static.	###many more deaths --n402e4c have occurred in --n402e5f and dealing with --n402e76 coal plants then ever around nuclear plants.###it's kind of funny because people are just petrified, at least some are, at the thought of nuclear.###.###yes.###.###so, i don't know.###in europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power###and they recycle the fuel###and then instead of, of,###some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become, uh, bomb quality.###but, that's the only sensible thing to do --n40339a, is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground. as far as i'm concerned, where it could eventually, perhaps, there's some problem, uh, pollute the groundwater --n403445.###so, i don't know what the answer is --n403646.###the best answer, of course, would be solar or, uh, fusion, or something clean.###.###yes.###.###well, we've got a problem on the line, don't we.###.###yeah.### i, i get that sometimes, um,
103624:72	it's just, you know, a possible solution in the future, i think --n404844, maybe to help in some ways.	###uh-huh..###uh-huh.###.###and we have enough clouds that, uh,###there are other areas that --n404344 would be better suited.###that surprised me because i think, we have a tremendous amount of, um, sunny days.###.###.### and, and it,###yes,###it can be used --n40454a###and it can help###but, uh, that was a problem that they were still working --n4045f8 on.###but,###.###oh yeah.### it, it's still got a long way to go --n404716.###.###well i,###.
103644:40	i, i think, with solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well.	###it's just, you know, a possible solution in the future, i think --n404844, maybe to help in some ways.###.###yes.###.###it may not in all ways.###maybe they'll come up with fusion. you know, con-, be able --n404a0e to control it.###i don't know how long that'll take --n404b2a,###but, one of these days,###because that's perfectly clean.###.###yes.###.###it's just we can't control it.###right now it --n404cf3 takes more energy --n404d06 to cause fusion to occur then you get out,###so, it isn't,###not at all,###and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field,###so that's not going --n404f3f to work.###at least not now.###but, uh, who --n404fef knows what the future will hold --n40500e. uh, as far as energy goes,
103644:84	i, i think, with solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well.	###it's just, you know, a possible solution in the future, i think --n404844, maybe to help in some ways.###.###yes.###.###it may not in all ways.###maybe they'll come up with fusion. you know, con-, be able --n404a0e to control it.###i don't know how long that'll take --n404b2a,###but, one of these days,###because that's perfectly clean.###.###yes.###.###it's just we can't control it.###right now it --n404cf3 takes more energy --n404d06 to cause fusion to occur then you get out,###so, it isn't,###not at all,###and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field,###so that's not going --n404f3f to work.###at least not now.###but, uh, who --n404fef knows what the future will hold --n40500e. uh, as far as energy goes,
103701:14	we'll have some interesting discussion, i guess --n4002be.	###.###now, i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes,###and...###.###.###so, how do you feel about capital punishment --n400036.###.###well, it's,###i am pretty much against it.###.###really.###.###yeah.###how about you.###.###oh, i'm pretty much for it.###.###oh, good###we can have a debate.###.
103788:26	but you know i guess to some people it --n4022b7'd almost be better --n4022ce to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever	###speakeranan*t32-2.###speakera32-3*t32-3.###or whatever###and most of the time i hear myself saying well you know we don't have enough room left --n401eac in the jails###speakerbnan*t32-3.###.###and people crime is still climbing###.###.###and we need --n401ffa to have different punishments you know.###.###right.###.###but i just am scared of capital punishment, i guess --n4020d6.###.###yeah.###well i can underst-###.###.### i i mean you know there there is always that chance
103868:139	, i mean, i'm, i'm not saying i, i think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case, you know, especially because there are some cases when you just don't know --n40427a	###.###.###yeah.###.###and, i guess, they said, you know, sh-, do you think it should be restricted --n403c5c.###i guess, if it were, if, if,###because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment###.###uh-huh.###.###i guess violent crimes would be the crimes where i can see it making the most sense --n403f32.###.###yeah.###.###you know, violent crimes with no, uh, with just malicious intent.###.###right,###exactly.###yeah.###well, you know, that's exactly
103911:47	and, and, it really isn't, for some people tha-, who --n405629 have been there for over, and over, and over, it really isn't, uh, as bad.	###.###right.###.###but, uh, i don't know.###it's just,###.###well, i was, i saw on a human interest story, or whatever today, there was a woman who --n40503b was just being paroled --n405052 and trying --n405061 to make it back,###she was off drugs and everything,###.###uh-huh.###.###but she said, uh, you know, in prison you can get anything.###you can any drugs you want --n40534c.###there's,### it, it's just like being outside.###you know, people find ways around.###.###really.###.###and there's a power structure that you have bow to --n405554

104203:4	some, i don't even, i recognize the, the melodies, and whatnot,	###oh.###.###it was real nice.###.###well, that's really, yeah that's, i bet that was nice.###.###yeah.###it went well,###it was a change, you know, from your traditional, normal, you know, stuff, and since it was christmas time and, and, uh, we had the church decorated --n403420 with christmas hollies and poinsettias and, you know, stuff like that###and so, we did the harpsichord with old-time traditional christmas carols,###.###oh.###.### not, not, you know, the bouncy, you know sing along kind but some of the old, older ones that###.###right.###.###.###right.###.
104230:49	it's kind of haunting, you know, on, on some of the notes.	###well actually, i play, i play the violin in, in a string quartet that --n403a8e often plays at weddings.###.###um.###.###so, um, i always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, it makes, it makes it nice.###it makes, you know,###you can say classy###or it --n403e14 makes an elegant wedding to have something else.###.###it does.###.###.###it really does###and it has such a different sound to it, anyway.###it's almost,###i don't know the way it vibrates --n40400a,
104255:44	does it, does it offer, like band, or some of the instruments.	###.###i don't know how else to explain --n40428f.###but, we've got friends that --n40431f are in the music business that --n40433e go around dallas,###they're, uh, called --n404424 odessa.###it's a husband and wife team that we've known --n4044b0 for years###and, uh, we try --n40455b to make contact with them periodically --n40457a to see what --n40458d's going on and stuff, too,###so we've had a lot of stuff, you know, friends and, and things --n4046f2 to do with music that constant,###plus my husband's real big into music, too,###so. he doesn't play anything,###but, he just likes --n404923 to listen.###.###yeah.###.###and my dad and###my kids are now well,###my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs --n404a6f###and when they come on --n404b35 we have --n404b44 to turn the radio up full blast###and,###.###oh. now does, does the school in, in your, in your city,
104342:23	and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was, was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were --n4007ea.	###so, it's been fun.###.###i don't know if any of mine will be interested in it###or...###.###.###okay.###well, let's see,###well, we keep our paper, paper bags lined --n4000c1 up in the garage for glass and, glass and, uh, plastics###and, uh, we make the dump over to the wal-mart bins there as soon as they're full.###i guess we collect m-, milk cartons and whatever p-, other plastics --n40033a are acceptable.###.###are you in the part of town where, uh, they have gotten into the other containers --n400476 yet for recycling --n400489.###.###no,###no,###i didn't think that anybody had those at all yet.###.###well, maybe they don't.### i, i know that was supposed --n4006ab to be in may
104694:41	and there's some, i think there's some good disney movies fixing to come out on video, uh, shipwrecked.	###so, we, we watch a lot of movies around that category, you know that she, that she can watch --n40241b.###.###oh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###my son just turned two###and so the little mermaid is now our favorite movie.###.###yeah.###we seen the little mermaid, too.###.###little mermaid and peter pan i think --n4026e3 are, are his two favorites that we've got --n402712.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.
105043:10	i got some good recipes from them sometimes,	###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###and i get into, uh, newspapers,###so i guess that kind of tells you what kind of person i am --n4016c0.###i'm, re-, read it fast and put it down.###.###right.###uh-huh.### when, when i had my magazines at home --n40188c, i would find that i kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures, you know,###and if something caught my eye, then i might read something,###.###right.###.###but otherwise than that, you know, they were, uh, you know, not too useful to me. you know###.###well, that's what i do --n401c1d.###.
105128:69	i, when i bought the computer --n403931, all of a sudden i was receiving them, for some unknown reason, through the mail.	###right,### al-, although now,###.###but, uh, you know, that's basically just about,###i'll buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then.###.###that's when you really have time --n403395.###now see your computer ones,###i got into computer work somewhat, uh,###we have our own computer system at home###.###uh-huh.###.###and i tried, uh, --n403552 reading the magazines --n403565 hoping i would get more from it###and it was just above my head without having someone --n403669 there --n403678 to give me the advice as i went along.###.###uh-huh.###.###it was, you know, kind of a little bit more than what i needed --n4037fa,###so i never did get into them.
105163:15	uh, there's some, uh,	###okay.###.###it --n403dbb was nice talking with you.###.###it --n403e45 was nice to talk with you, too.###.###okay.###.### thank you.###.###uh-huh.###bye, now.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###the aids issue is, is a bit of a problem.###i guess the first thing that --n4000d9 comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem, is, is the financial end.###and how can a country stand --n400260 to, uh, spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem --n4002b3, uh,###but, then that kind of thinking is also tempered --n4003ea with the, the knowledge, or at least the, the rumor, i'm not really sure if it's true or not, that, uh, we're not spending as much per, let's say --n4004a5, afflicted person on cancer.
105207:38	i, i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want --n401ffa to give to --n40200d. uh, be it through different organizations, march of dimes type, uh, telethons or, or bicycle rides or whatever, how they fund whatever, uh, illness they wish --n4020a0 --n4020a7.	###and, it's just### one of those, uh, course, one of the shows i saw --n401280 was taking it from the angle that, since it doesn't effect men, it's not going --n4012d3 to get funded --n4012e6.###and, uh, having thought about that for a while,###.###what did you think --n40153a about that idea.###.###well, i, i kind of, i thought, well, that, that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing.###but then i got, i got to --n4017f7 thinking, the, the number one killer of men seems --n40182e to be the prostate###and there's only one test that --n401987 just recently got developed --n40199e, uh, a blood in-, antigen, uh, antibody test for the antigen in the blood###and that's fairly recent.###and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years.###.###they've not really given it attention either,###yeah.###.###so it's not really cured --n401cc0,###yeah,###it's not, uh, not that heavily funded --n401d4f either###and then that seems --n401de5 to be one of the, the major, uh, problems that men have --n401e28 in the realm of cancer,###so, i don't know.
105330:44	i, i have a real fear, but that at some point something's going --n401d02 to happen.	###and even in our field we have people that --n40146f are in very high risk jobs###and we, at the present time, do not have random testing.###.###um.###.###and i am pushing towards that.### i, i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide --n401669, they shouldn't have a problem with it.###.###right.###.###and if they are trying --n4017da to hide something, then i have --n4017fd to know that, because we're t-, we're talking major liabilities.###not only with themselves, but with other employees.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i really, you know,### they, they're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that i, i would much, much prefer --n401acf having doctors and airline pilots tested --n401aee on a random basis --n401b05.###.###yeah.###.
105338:42	uh, some people just, uh, i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that,	###right.###.###and if they are trying --n4017da to hide something, then i have --n4017fd to know that, because we're t-, we're talking major liabilities.###not only with themselves, but with other employees.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i really, you know,### they, they're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that i, i would much, much prefer --n401acf having doctors and airline pilots tested --n401aee on a random basis --n401b05.###.###yeah.###.### i, i have a real fear, but that at some point something's going --n401d02 to happen.###and they're showing it with aids,###so why, you know,### they sh-, they ought --n401eb5 to start --n401ec4 doing something with the drugs.###so i really have no problem with it.###.###yeah.###well, it's, it's unfortunate, i think --n402056, that everyone doesn't have that opinion.
105485:20	but, uh, we did some water skiing --n401ecb, of course, and, and, uh, driving around the lake in the boat	###-n4010db to learn the maneuvers you had to make --n401106 to work your way down a lake or work back up against the, the wind, as it were, --n401161 tacking back and forth###and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day###and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing###and as soon as the front came over, it was calm.###so you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle###and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start --n4015d0 raining on you right away.###and that didn't always work.###we oftentimes got wet,.###but, uh, it's, it's a nice, nice hobby to have --n401797.###nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time,###nor do we live that close to a lake anymore,###so things change, i guess --n4019d9.###what are your memories of boating --n401a53,###or current,###.###uh, about the only memories that i have --n401afb of boating, uh,###my husband's family had a, a motor boat, uh, when we got engaged --n401bdf --n401be6###and they took us out on the lake several times.###and, uh, i really did enjoy that.### i, i don't know that i ever learned --n401dc8 to drive it or anything,
105820:32	because i think they may put them into some sort of a program --n400ed2 to get them off of drugs.	###.###uh-huh.###.###i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it.###.###uh-huh.###.###it's, uh,###i don't know,###i don't really liken it to alcohol###but, yet that can be carried --n400aec to an extreme, too.###.###uh-huh.###.###so i think it's a good idea###and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested --n400c42 might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're,###.###right.###.###i don't know that their job would be at risk,
105896:51	and i think it --n40255a's good that they're trying --n402579 to start some programs down in the elementary schools.	###.###also, i guess you can, you know, get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by --n40218f having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever, all kinds.###.###that's right.###.###.###oh yeah.###.###i sub in the schools###.###uh-huh.###.###so i've, you know, had a,### they they talk a lot about drugs there###.###so,###.###.###right.###.
106267:29	i'd have --n401fb6 to go back through some expense reports.	###of course, not too many people want --n4018e1 to rush back to panama city, uh, panama, the country, uh, panama.###.###oh, okay,###because i was thinking,###well, i, i grew up in panama city.###.###no### this is the country this is the country panama,###all right.###.###i get it.###.###.###right.###.### and, uh, but i have gotten to quite a few.###and i go to canada and get quite a few restaurants up there.### i, you know, and i know the locations,###and i know the places,###but i, lot of times i don't remember the names.
106271:49	but particularly, down in your area, i'm looking for some, some more restaurants.	###well, i, i grew up in panama city.###.###no### this is the country this is the country panama,###all right.###.###i get it.###.###.###right.###.### and, uh, but i have gotten to quite a few.###and i go to canada and get quite a few restaurants up there.### i, you know, and i know the locations,###and i know the places,###but i, lot of times i don't remember the names.###i'd have --n401fb6 to go back through some expense reports.###.###uh-huh.###.
106391:27	this is going --n4041e3 to give me some more places to go --n404212.	###.###.###really.###.###and, um, it's great,###i mean, their, they have,###i think,###sometimes i've been when i thought, well, it wasn't as good --n403e7c,###but i went there recently,###and i thought, well, this really is good.###.###uh-huh.###.###so that's, that's a very good place to eat --n404052, the blue mesa grill.###.###good.###.###and, um,###.###well, this is great.
106437:19	but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do --n101a7.	###.###okay,###.###it --n4049c4 was a pleasure talking to you.###.###well, thanks for calling for helping us out.###.###okay.###.###.###you bet,###.###bye-bye.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###how would you feel --n10022 about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home.###.###well, i don't feel very good about it,
106565:53	well that's, yeah, that's right that the children have some responsibility --n12c44 --n12c4b, too, to their parents and such, to help decide what --n12c8e's the right thing.	###but he was living alone, had an upstairs apartment, could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain,###.###oh.###.###and this,###eventually things just went too far###.###yeah.###.###and he allowed himself to be put --n1282c into a nursing home.###.###yes,###well, i think sometimes when people get --n128f4 to be a certain age --n1290f, other people have --n12926 to kind of help them make decisions.###it --n12a5c sure wouldn't have been granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home,###but she's accepted it real well now###.###right###.###so.###.
106619:25	and the second one was i bought some toys at a, um, at a craft fair.	###.###.###the first one, um,###i helped someone repaint an apartment,###and it was very easy.###.###uh-huh,### it, was it.###.###yeah,###and i've never painted anyth-,###i always thought it would be,###so, you know, you'd have --n400541 to hire someone if you needed --n400560 to paint inside your house or something###.###yeah,###.###but i know i can do it.###.###oh, uh-huh.###.
106658:65	i had --n4016af to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go --n4016f2 buy some paint thinner, and mumblex and everything like that,	###.###i mean, i kind of knew, in the back of my mind,###.###so you can't use oil on wood.###.###well, no,###you can use it on wood,###but i just had it all over my hands,###and i went --n4012ec to wash the brushes out, and, uh, wash my hands,###and you can't wash it off with water.###you have --n401439 to get the, uh, a solution###and,###.###oh, so you had --n401516 to go around with paint all over you, temporarily, anyway.###.###yeah,###i had --n40161e to drive to the store###.###.###yeah,
106691:93	well, um, so to speak, i had --n402498 to paint this, uh, the inside of this warehouse thing that you keep some, um, farm equipment in --n4024f7	###um.###.###the same with the toys,###it --n401da0's just important to look for one that --n401dcb doesn't have lead in it, you know,###it says safe for children, and all that.###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###i heard about that.###i guess a friend of mine had a, uh, well,### she, she just started up a day care center,###and uh, the, one of the real strict, uh, restrictions, was the fact that she had --n40218d to have a special kind of paint that --n4021b4 was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff###.###yeah.###.###so, uh, she had that done --n40238d.###but, uh,###.###have you painted anything recently.###.
107048:12	and then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form, uh, causes you to realize how much --n400cb0 is left --n400cbf.	###especially for these times.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, but that depends, you know, on the individual if they can i guess have self-control.###.###well, that's a lot of it.###uh, i know we tried several different ways.###one time we tried something that --n40070b really worked###but we didn't keep it up.###i passed it on to a friend###and she won't quit --n40085a doing it.###she loves it###and that was the envelope system. where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did --n400945 last month that you are going --n400964 to spend --n400973 --n40097a,###.###uh-huh.###.###and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that.###so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera.
107258:36	and i think though that we need --n404fea to have some liquid --n405001 around that you don't have --n405020 to go through the company --n40503b to get --n40504a.	###um,###.###so if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale, you're just real careful --n404a4a not to let your urges get hold of you.###.###yes.###.### that's, that's excellent.###that's what i'm working toward --n404c45.###i think you're probably much ahead of me there###and i'm working on it.###.###and i never worried about --n404dbd saving money because we just, we're in the savings plan at work###and they took it out###so,###.###same here,###same here.###.###i, uh,###.
107469:25	and there are, you know, some places that --n403297 will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff.	###well, for a bigger city they're pretty thick.###.###yeah,###they are.###.###and sometimes you might have two or three.###.###exactly.###.###so, uh, that's, that's a big savings right there in itself.###.###yeah,###see ours just goes in the regular trash.###.###yeah,###.###it just, you know, there's not a whole lot.###.###huh.###.
107549:47	i have a friend who --n1040a just went to, like, wyoming to some big ranch, you know, where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion --n10479.	###you too.###.###bye-bye.###.###bye.###.###.###how would you go about --n10026 organizing a family reunion --n1003d.###.###well, a-,###for,###i grew up in the deep south like south alabama.###so whenever i think of family reunions --n101af,###my family, like, got together almost every week.###.###oh, gee.###.###and there would be like thirty people.###so people talk about, you know, big family reunions###and i think, like
107709:28	and i think we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity.	###so it's kind of nice.###i don't know how yours has been --n401993.###.###well, it's been real hot here lately.###i mean we've had --n401a94 to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything###but, uh, doe-,###it's supposed --n401b9d to rain again now, uh, this weekend.###.###oh, i see.###.###so, then,###.###okay.###well, we're leaving tomorrow###and we're going down to new orleans###and from ohio since we're right near lake erie###this is going --n401e1b to be a switch for us for a week going down there,###.###yeah.###.
107796:20	i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing,	###yeah,###are you there.###.###yes.###.###okay.###do you know the question for today.###.###uh, yes.###it's about why there aren't more people that --n400158 are voting and participating in --n400173...###.###and what is your feeling --n400244.###do you think this is vital important.###.###oh, absolutely.###.###okay.###do you,###.###um, i think that, uh, it's kind of discouraging to, uh,
107802:43	i, it, i have worked in some campaigns	###do you know the question for today.###.###uh, yes.###it's about why there aren't more people that --n400158 are voting and participating in --n400173...###.###and what is your feeling --n400244.###do you think this is vital important.###.###oh, absolutely.###.###okay.###do you,###.###um, i think that, uh, it's kind of discouraging to, uh,###i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing,###and it --n4004f9's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not,###a lot of them are so ill informed###they have no idea, you know, even that there's an election### or, and these are people that --n40071a are registered.###.
107909:42	and i don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this --n40344e.	###actually, you know, my husband has run for office before###and sometimes it --n402b0d's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because, you know, if you're going --n402b70 to be tied up that day, uh, campaigning or whatever it might be. um, that kind of, just kind of takes that load off, you know,###you can just go ahead and get that taken care of --n402e81###and...###.###but that is an excuse and that would, i could live with --n402f5c.###.###uh-huh.###.###but this idea of anyone wel-,### i ju-, i am so bitterly opposed to this.###if you're busy, that has always been a legitimate excuse.###if you are incapacitated, ill health,###.###uh-huh.###.###but to have the expense of,### let's see.###they have five, six people at my polling place.###they can come from all over the city,
108182:30	i guess you have --n401175 to take some things and leave some things.	###as soon as we got out of the cloud cover.###of course it wasn't sunny like it is here.###it was real gray###.###yeah.###.###but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and i saw all those trees, it just really made me realize how much i miss the fall --n400d23.###.###yeah.###.###i don't complain weather wise though, because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning,###.###.###and the high was only fifty,###and it was supposed --n400f9c to drop and get sleet in the afternoon###.###ooh.###.###so it --n401060 was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies --n40109f.###.
108182:40	i guess you have --n401175 to take some things and leave some things.	###as soon as we got out of the cloud cover.###of course it wasn't sunny like it is here.###it was real gray###.###yeah.###.###but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and i saw all those trees, it just really made me realize how much i miss the fall --n400d23.###.###yeah.###.###i don't complain weather wise though, because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning,###.###.###and the high was only fifty,###and it was supposed --n400f9c to drop and get sleet in the afternoon###.###ooh.###.###so it --n401060 was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies --n40109f.###.
108299:70	but when i don't need --n4007f8 to dress up for a, a meeting or a service of some sort --n400837, i don't.	###why don't you start --n400040###so you probably have a job you need --n4000a7 to get to --n4000ba pretty soon.###.###i'm already on my job###.###oh, you are,###.###so, you, you reached me at my job.###.###oh, wonderful,###well how do you dress for work --n400308.###.### my, my dress for work, uh, most of the time is, uh, rather comfortable and casual uh, usually, uh, slacks and a soft colored shirt.###.###uh-huh.###.###the, um, thing that, that --n40053d distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have --n40056c to dress real professionally for a meeting or something --n400597 is i wear a clerical collar and a suit and, uh, all of that sort of thing,###.###uh-huh.###.
108349:80	so you don't have --n401b0b to, you don't have --n401b2a to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do --n401b81.	###so you'll still see people,### it, it's kind of an in between change, that they're in their play clothes, i mean, they're in their summer clothes during the afternoons, because you just can't stand the sweaters,###but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly.###.### today, today we, we wear coats###and as the day, uh, warms up, we may go to light jackets,###.###did you.###.###but i don't think there's an escape from light jackets.###.###i understand.###.###the wind will take away a lot of body heat.###.###well, so are the people around you, um, dressing similar to you.###.###very similar.###.###uh-huh,
108521:93	uh, lot of the shows that, that i've liked --n4013c6 in the past, like, uh, oh, golden girls and, some of them tend --n401415 to get so risque,	###.###wonder years.###.###wonder years,###yeah,###that's my favorite.###uh,###.###i like both of those real much also.### i, i think basically, they pr-, same thing, they promote family values.###.###yeah.###wonder years,### i, i guess that is supposed --n400e10 to be put --n400e23 out at a time when i was growing up or whatever --n400e56.###i guess i can really relate to it,###and, uh, it's just a real cute show.###uh, i, i guess i like the shows that --n4010c6 really have a real sense of, uh, i don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, i guess --n401131.###.###i do, too.### i, i don't like it,

108856:37	you can't understand what they're saying --n402f7a on some of those songs which --n402f99 probably is just as well on some of them, too.	###.###and so the, the musicians don't get --n40291c to really get into their music.###they just play a certain number of chords###.###yeah.###.###the drummer plays a certain beat,###and you have a country and western song###.###um.###.###and,###.###well, that's kind of the way i feel --n402b7e about rock and roll sometimes, too, i guess --n402bb1.###they don't really,### has kind of the same sound over and over,###and the other thing i don't like --n402d71 about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are --n402dd8###.###um. right.###.

108972:69	and it consisted of, of grilled kielbasa sausage uh, a potato salad with olive oil, and uh, some tomatoes that --n402090 had been chopped --n4020a3 up with onions and curry powder	###now, now, i, i find that the cutting up of the food, and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes.###.###yeah,###either they're really fast###or,###uh-huh.###.###.### but they're, but they're, but they're interesting they're interesting menus, um, combinations that you wouldn't have, nobody thought of --n401b7e.###.###uh-huh.###.###um.###.###speakera42-1*t42-1.###what's one of your favorites --n401d64.###speakerbnan*t42-1.###speakerb42-2*t42-2.###um, gee,###the one i had --n401e05 most recently was, was one that, was, ha-, she, she describes --n401e68 as jim beard's favorite, um, summer menu, or something,

109040:25	we, we had some friends over as recently as saturday night	###yes.###.###that's why sometimes i shy away from, uh, more of a traditional cookbook --n402d52###.###uh-huh.###but, well, it --n402e26 was interesting talking to you.###it's a fun subject.###.###food is one of my favorite things too.###.###yes.###.###speakera62-1*t62-1.###anything else you wanted --n402fa9 to add --n402fb8.###speakerbnan*t62-1.###speakerb62-2*t62-2.###well, you had said dinner, you know, you know,###what would i put --n403100 together for a formal dinner.###speakeranan*t62-2.###.
109067:18	marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, um, and cooked with some olives and some, and some prunes, uh,	###speakeranan*t64-2.###speakerb65-1*t65-1.###the inspiration was a combination of julia child for the dessert, you know, a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of mumblex cookbook which --n403392 has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella um, which --n4033cd is this wonderful thing you can do --n4033f4, um,###speakeranan*t65-1.###speakera65-2*t65-2.###uh-huh,###speakerbnan*t65-2.###.###that's good.###.###uh-huh.###basically you're baking, baking chicken in a, in an open pan, um, --n4036a2 having marinated it first###and, my wife did this part###.###so i don't remember all the details###.###speakera70-1*t70-1.###uh-huh.###speakerbnan*t70-1.###speakerb70-2*t70-2.

109255:17	the second thing is some colleges only offer the, uh, liberal arts and, uh, whereas like state, they offer engineering courses	###uh-huh.###.###and so i was going to school for, you know, just a few hundred dollars a semester,###and she was paying forty dollars an hour###.###golly,###.###so she paid ten times as much because she was out of state.###.###yeah,###luckily i've paid in state tuition the whole time.###.###oh, that's good.###yeah,###so i think that would be one thing i would definitely consider --n40136b try --n40137a to find a school within the state that, um, i liked --n4013b5 well enough --n4013c4 to attend.###.###uh-huh, um,###.###.###uh-huh.
109269:7	well some schools may even give you financial aid, where another one won't --n401999.	###so i think that would be one thing i would definitely consider --n40136b try --n40137a to find a school within the state that, um, i liked --n4013b5 well enough --n4013c4 to attend.###.###uh-huh, um,###.###.###uh-huh.###the second thing is some colleges only offer the, uh, liberal arts and, uh, whereas like state, they offer engineering courses###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right,###yeah.###.###so depending on what your major is --n40174d, or medical, you might want --n401770 to atteck-, some, um, attend somewhere like tech###.###yeah,###right.###.###and, um, aside from the, uh,
109394:16	but i guess some of the other smaller colleges might, might be a lot different.	###.###and, uh, you don't get near the, uh, quality of education,###and as well, the, uh, smaller schools often times don't cost as much.###.###um, i didn't know that.###.###oh, yeah.###.###um. well, i guess the only comparison i had ever heard --n40383d was between a, a christian college, because i thought about --n403874 attending abilene christian instead of texas tech###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and of course the price was just astronomical compared to tech###.###um.###.###the christian college was so much more expensive.
109644:34	so, i guess we're old timers compared to some people.	###we, um, recently moved here from north carolina,###and they had curbside recycling,###and it --n4003c7 was very easy to, you know, to put everything out there,###but we don't have it in, at least in our neighborhood right now###.###yeah.###.### and, uh, so, i've been very guilty about --n4005f5 not making the effort --n40060c to, to take things where take things where they belong --n40064b.###.###well, how long have you been here --n4007de.###.###well, we've been here since january,###so we, we still feel very new,###.###well,###.###but, uh it's working up to a year now,###.###yeah.###.
109712:50	but the trucks that --n401e03 were supposed to do it, there's been some problems with --n401e3e from what i've read --n401e59 in, you know, the mail that we get --n401e88	###yeah.###.###so###.###better than nothing,###right.###.###and what i hear --n401914 a lot of neighborhoods do have the, the pickup now,###and we, hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of october.###.###yeah,###i,###it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that, you know it's coming in a couple of months,###.###yeah,###and, i think it's been delayed --n401cc9.###.###but.###.###i think it was originally scheduled --n401d71 for february,
110307:25	i mean i think sometimes some of the, the women's lib though, is kind of like they wanted it all, you know,	###well i guess we're supposed --n400631 to talk about the changing roles of women.###.###yeah.###.### seems like, um, to me, everything is just changing so much that it's almost like, um, you can't keep up with things any more,###and everything is, uh, ther-, everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women,###i personally, i'm a stay home mom,###and i like it the way it used --n400a8a to be --n400a99.###.###so am --n400b3c i.###.###are you,###.###you know, i think it's kind of coming back around to that, don't you,###i mean, that there's a lot more people --n400ce4 that --n400cef stay home now than before,###but i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting --n400e0f to have the choice of what they could do --n400e3a, you know###.###yeah.###.###i don't know,
110359:35	like just over the weekend i visited my family, and some cousins i hadn't seen --n402e85 in a long time,	### she, she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care,###and, uh, i just think, i, i, i just don't agree with that.###i think it should be that people should get back to staying home and, and being family, more family oriented than, than not.###you know, it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing --n402156 that there's no time for this and that and the other,###and i hope it just doesn't get --n4022de to where, you know, there's more women, more and more women going into the work force --n402335.###.###well, i agree,###i mean, but, i, i hate for them to make people --n4024e8 feel bad that --n4024fb have --n402506 to work, too, saying, you know, you should stay home, you know, otherwise your children aren't going --n402575 to, you know, turn out, or whatever because that's not fair to, you know, like the single moms that --n4025e0 have --n4025eb to work,###.###yeah.###.###or, if they wouldn't be able --n40294a to make ends meet not working or whatever,###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, i think it's got --n402a62 to be a personal choice,###and, it --n402b29's nice that, that we could have the choice to stay home.###.###yeah,###well i find that i, whenever i have --n402c7a to, whenever i'm in a group of people --n402cb1 and we're discussing things --n402ccc,
110384:95	but i've really noticed that there are a lot of, uh, a lot more people that --n403dec are more comfortable, at least, with some women being home and, at least in the circles i've travelled --n403e4f and in the church that i go to --n403e76, you know,	###.###but it's like, you know, here these people are --n40322e,###they're going to school, getting degrees, making all this money,###and, you know, they kind of looked at me like i was from the dark ages, you know, like i, because i didn't have really all that much to talk about --n4033fd, uh, where career and things like that were concerned --n403430,###and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes,###.###yeah.###.###which --n403723 is too bad, because, you know, i, i feel like i don't, obviously i don't get paid --n403796 for my job,###but i should get paid --n40390e at least double what my husband makes --n403931 --n403938 working in an office for staying home###.###yeah.###.###that's what i figure --n403a6e,###i'm worth a lot just for what i do --n403af2 every day,###but, you know, i don't know,###this is kind of a, um,### at, at least here i've noticed,###i'm not from here,###i'm from colorado,
110398:27	i found when i did do some work --n4045cf when my son was young --n4045ea, it was like contract work,	###i'm worth a lot just for what i do --n403af2 every day,###but, you know, i don't know,###this is kind of a, um,### at, at least here i've noticed,###i'm not from here,###i'm from colorado,###but i've really noticed that there are a lot of, uh, a lot more people that --n403dec are more comfortable, at least, with some women being home and, at least in the circles i've travelled --n403e4f and in the church that i go to --n403e76, you know,###that###men don't treat you like you don't know anything, generally speaking.###.###yeah.###.###.###well, and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or, you know, even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff,###and i think that's really important that, that they do that###.###yeah.###.###and they realize there's a need for that,###and, um, i don't know,
110538:57	ours, um, ours barks more than, um, than some, because she spent a lot of time at our friends' house.	###.###bichon frise.###.###okay.###i'm writing it out phonetically,###.###yeah.###they're, uh,###and they don't shed###so they're, they're good dogs for people with, with allergies,###.###yes,###.###and they love people,###and they're,###.###do they bark a lot.###.###um, no,###not really.
110628:20	um, but she might have some contacts here,	###oh, yes.###.###.###just pets,###.###.###yes,###that's what we'd rather have --n4037d0 is just a pet, instead of###.###ri-,###.###we used --n4038b6 to show saint bernards when i was a little girl --n4038e5.###we did that every weekend,###.###oh, but, yeah, takes a lot of time.###.###yes,###and it's very expensive.###.###yeah,
111180:94	um, i think i'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected --n40013b to, to deal with --n400156 in some quality way.	###i've always been a creature of comfort, too###.###me, too.###.###if it's not comfortable, forget it.###.###i know,###that's how i am --n14b42, too,###.###wool was never comfortable to me.###.###right,###me neither,###i have,###.###.###do you see anything wrong with public school systems.###.###well, yes,###i do.
111232:37	what child --n4014e1's going --n4014f0 to say something some parent's going --n401517 to overreact to --n40152a	###i love --n400d61 to work with children and to teach them,###.###me, too.###.###but i'm really having questions if, if i can deal with that system and, and have a good conscience about, you know, what i do --n400ebc.### i don't think, i don't think it's the teachers,###i think it's the system###.###i think so too.###.###but, um.###.###they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get --n40120f on tests --n40121e now and teacher competency, you know,###.###right.###.###and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best,###she's always worried who --n40142b's looking over her shoulder###and,###.
111284:76	but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with, i mean, some kind of partitions you know,	###yep,###i am too.###.###you too.###.###and i have one in ninth grade at clark and one at hendrick this year,###and he, my nin-, my, uh, sixth grader came from an open classroom at matthews,###and the very first year i taught --n402091 back in seventy-three, we had open classroom###and it didn't work then###.###oh.###.###and when we moved down here --n4021d1, i was just appalled that they were still doing it here,###.###still at it.###.###.###well the explanation i was, was given --n40232a --n402331 about, you know,### they, they seemed --n402423 to admit that it wasn't working,###but they didn't have the money to restructure --n402512,
111374:15	but yet she has some every night.	###yep.###.###and, uh, he's pleased with his classes.### i, i, i don't guess i've been in the high school long enough --n403b21 to, to know what --n403b3c to expect --n403b4b really you know, how --n403b66 to judge it --n403b79.###.###yeah.###.###.###my daughter seems --n403d78 to be having a good time,###she was absent with strep throat the last three days,###and i ran over and picked up her report card,###and she did very good,### so and she seems --n403f50 to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work i would expect for a freshman to have --n403faf.###.###well, that's good.###.###.###yeah.###.###she's not bogged --n404158 down,
111407:85	i was just in the shower after --n400616 finishing mowing the lawn and, you know, --n400645 mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden,	###but, who --n4045e0 knows what he's going --n4045fb to bring --n40460a home.###.###.###that's right.###.###.###okay,###mumblex i missed a part of it.###we're --n4000a2 to talk about what, lawns and gardens.###.###lawn and garden work and what you enjoy --n400159 and what kind of work you do --n40017c.### i'm, i'm a putterer.###i chose that topic because i really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###i, well,### it's, it's, it --n40046d's very str-, strange that i got this call because my wife just called me.
111488:40	but we're still fighting bugs, and ready --n4024c9 to change some of the, the summer flowers out	###.###well, it is, it is for me###because i've been doing a lot of fertilizing.###we had a terrible summer,###we had a drought###.###oh.###.###and, uh, took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing,###and now it's really growing###and i'm trying --n402269 to establish a good root, root growth you know, for the winter.###.###um###.###.###ours seems --n402384 to have slowed down here.###we're not having --n402410 to mow every week religiously###.###really.###.
111669:74	and he's, he, he must be part, cross part with some kind of desert animal, because he's very long and lanky,	###.###yeah,###i have a cat now.###he just turned seven, also,###and he's, i, um, got him in arizona and, when i used --n400ba5 to live there --n400bb8,###.###oh.###.###and he is huge.###he is eighteen pounds.###.###what kind of cat is it --n400d82.###.###just,###um, i got him,### he was, um, he was born --n400e77 in the wild, like in a, in a shed and had never been in a building when i got him --n400ed6.###.###uh-huh.###.###so he,
111758:13	and i had some time off in the afternoon,	###it sort of has a bob tail.###i kind of like that, too,###but.###.###yeah.###i'd love --n402987 to go to a cat show.###i'm real, a real cat lover.###i'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let u-, let me.###.###.###he doesn't really like mine, let alone another one.###.###well, i'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog --n402c55,###and then i suppose our five minutes will be up.###.###yeah.###okay.###.###i work for a university,###and i went to, uh, omaha, nebraska --n402e39 to recruit students,
111782:30	and so that night we had a reception for some of the, uh, potential high school students or college students,	###um.###.###and so i decided, well, you know, this would really be a nice dog to have --n40309b,###so, when i got back home to carney, nebraska --n4031a7, i told my wife about it,###and i said, you know, this is just a,### i, i, i can just hear the dog crying for me now.###.###i know what you mean --n40343b.###.###and christmas is coming up, hint, hint,###and so, i --n403517 had --n403522 to go back the next week, as well as a bunch of other people from the university,###and one of the people, uh, that we went with --n403677, uh, they were friends of ours,###and so, we got to omaha,###and i decided i'd take my friend over and show him the dog,###and so i got over there,###and she said, oh, that's too bad,###the dog has already been sold --n403987.###and i didn't realize it,###but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier, bought the dog,###and she was in the back room,
111906:16	well, what are some of your, your favorite inexpensive places --n401d50.	###uh-huh.###.###but we've eat, we eat out so much it's gotten so i don't like --n401916 to really eat any place###but yet i hate --n401a55 to cook food at home###.###oh.###.###so that might be why i look for inexpensive places --n401b18 just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###um.###.###or we eat junk food at home###.###yeah.###.###uh, now my husba-,###.
112046:99	and, uh, i was thinking about it after i got off the phone, that, that i really, you know, wish that there was some way to, uh, send a message --n400386 to people, you know, about, um, child abuse and things like that --n4003cd	###right.###.###if they're not there in between five and six, well, then i guess we don't eat today,###or you go you know you fend for yourself.###.###yep.###.###you go somewhere else.###so that, you know, that really snowballed when we got down here --n40455e, when i started --n404575 to sub, make money --n404590,###i went oh, well,###i'll just sub --n404725 to,###.###.###well i did hear the end of the prompt this time.###was that you, that we didn't hear the whole prompt.###.###yes,###yes,###.###and it said that what, what do we, do we think that cri-, certain crimes should fit certain punishments,
112051:20	those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment.	###yep.###.###you go somewhere else.###so that, you know, that really snowballed when we got down here --n40455e, when i started --n404575 to sub, make money --n404590,###i went oh, well,###i'll just sub --n404725 to,###.###.###well i did hear the end of the prompt this time.###was that you, that we didn't hear the whole prompt.###.###yes,###yes,###.###and it said that what, what do we, do we think that cri-, certain crimes should fit certain punishments,###and, uh, i was thinking about it after i got off the phone, that, that i really, you know, wish that there was some way to, uh, send a message --n400386 to people, you know, about, um, child abuse and things like that --n4003cd###.###uh-huh.###.###that, uh,
112058:22	i sometimes have a problem with some of the, especially more famous people who --n40090a all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork --n400939 to say that whatever problems they have --n40095c, you know, was, was because they were abused a-, abused --n4009a7 as children.	###.###well i did hear the end of the prompt this time.###was that you, that we didn't hear the whole prompt.###.###yes,###yes,###.###and it said that what, what do we, do we think that cri-, certain crimes should fit certain punishments,###and, uh, i was thinking about it after i got off the phone, that, that i really, you know, wish that there was some way to, uh, send a message --n400386 to people, you know, about, um, child abuse and things like that --n4003cd###.###uh-huh.###.###that, uh,###those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment.###too often i feel that --n4006e2 people get off, uh, without,###.###.###yeah,### i, i agree with you, although i will say,###i'm not sure, you know,
112125:40	and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some miss america was abused --n4024c5 by the man she loved --n4024e4	###so, my family may say that on occasion,###who --n401d62 knows###.###.###you know, uh, i, i don't think it --n401dda's that hard to do --n401dfd you know, to, to convince somebody that, uh, gee, you just had no control over what you were doing --n401e68,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah,###well, and too, you know, they can always be blaming the other person,###well, she looked like my mother who --n4021b9 abused me when i was a child --n4021dc, or something, which i think --n402203 is, unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh,###.###i guess, you know, a lot of,
112156:136	and, uh, you know, there was, there was, nothing on it, which --n4033a8 makes me wonder, you know, if it's as, uh, prevalent as, as some of them claim.	###but still.###.###well, you, you're right, uh,###and yet, i mean, did you ever in your life when you were little --n402fcd know anybody or hear anything of anything like this.###.###never###.###no,###.###and i lived in california which i feel like california, you know,###.###mumblex.###.###anything can go on in california.###.###ye-,###well, yes,### i, but i was from conservative wisconsin,###.###.
112290:7	and some of those	###right.###.###it's not the, the rinky chinese decorations###.###uh-huh.###.###but it's a very elegant nice place to eat.###.###uh-huh.###.### we go, very, very often we go out for fajitas.###that's###my husband has just gotten stuck.###.###oh.###.###and we go to on the border. and lots of places that --n401512 have, uh, i think mumblex###.###uh-huh.###.
112297:9	and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend --n40185d to want --n40186c to go --n40187b eat lasagna and garlic bread.	###.###uh-huh.###.### we go, very, very often we go out for fajitas.###that's###my husband has just gotten stuck.###.###oh.###.###and we go to on the border. and lots of places that --n401512 have, uh, i think mumblex###.###uh-huh.###.###and some of those###and get fajitas,###and he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then, uh, last weekend we went out for italian also,

112409:11	it's some famous steak place over in addison.	###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###and i really don't particularly, um,###.###well, i'm, i'm real curious --n402ec2 to try this one that --n402edd has such mumblex commercials. the uh, that del lincoln###and, oh, what is that guy's name --n403067.###they do those real corny commercials.###.###huh.###.### it's, uh, over, there's one over there in addison.###i can't remember his name.###anyhow it's some,###.###steak.###.###yeah,
112483:83	when, when i go out --n4045db, it's, it's normally to get, um, some specialty type of food	###.###but, um,###.###i had a friend who --n40417f was taken --n40418e to lawry's downtown for prime rib###.###uh-huh.###.###and i haven't been.###we usually don't go for beef really anymore.###.###uh-huh.###.###where,###we've gotten so used to --n40438e doing chicken and things at home that that's, that's usually the way we'll go --n4043e1 if we're not going lasagna.###.###right.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,
112498:14	and save you some money too.	###right.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,### when, when i go out --n4045db, it's, it's normally to get, um, some specialty type of food###.###uh-huh.###.###besides, you know, because y-, chicken and steaks and everything i grill --n4047a3 at home.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###i know.###well, i understand.###.### and, and really it's, they're a lot better than what i get --n404944 in the restaurant.###.###that's right,
112637:73	i would like --n401c2d to do that --n401c40 as a, as a family and, and some t v watching.	###.###.###and the, whatever season it is --n401252 he's, he's playing, although football is really his favorite.###.###oh, gee.###.###yeah.###so, uh, yeah,###we spend a lot of time, uh, uh, --n40144f carpooling and, uh, you know, and then trying --n40148e to be, uh, up as much as possible with anything that they, that they do --n4014dd.###.###right.###.###but then, uh, we also didn't do, spend, uh, time with them trying to, trying to,###uh, you know, just family time.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, we had a,###at a fairly young age we started --n401966 teaching them to play games and card games and so forth.### and, and, uh, uh, but we didn't, uh, do it as much or as often as, uh, i would have liked --n401ad6 to.
112844:32	i have worked in anoth-, at some other ones that --n400b69 were not very good in my opinion.	###and it's been quite a few years since i've had --n400497 to think about that.###.###do they go to a day-care center###or do they stay at,###.###no.###uh, m-, my daughter that --n400625 has three stays home with her children,###.###oh, that's nice.###.###and one of my daughters has one###but an aunt keeps the baby.###.###oh, that's nice.###.###but i would, i would not really know how to go about --n400881 selecting one nowadays --n400894,###but i would imagine it's very hard.###.### i, i think so.###i think it --n400a81's hard to find a good day care.
112989:20	but, but some people don't have a choice.	###do you think there's very many really good day-care centers around your area.###.###but, yeah,###.###.###in my area###because w-, i live in a college town in penn state university###.###uh-huh.###.###so i,###there is a lot of, a lot of college educated people and stuff that --n40336c are in the centers that --n403387 really seem --n403396 to have an idea of what --n4033b5's going on.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, in general though i've, i've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers i've worked at --n4035e3, and it, all and all###.###uh-huh.###.###it's not my choice for when, when i have children --n4037b2
113277:12	and we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under roger staubach.	###so football, i love this.###.###oh, yes.###.###this is great.###well, we're from colorado###so we're bronco fans.###and, um, we just moved here two years ago###and they went to the superbowl when we first moved here --n4003ba###and they lost again.###that was pretty pitiful,###but they seem --n4004c7 to be doing pretty good this year.###.###well, i was from illinois originally,###and i grew up --n4005cc a bear fan.###and, uh, then we moved here###even when we knew we were being transferred --n4006b4 here --n4006bf we became cowboy fans.###.###oh.###.
113457:49	and when the cowboys won the superbowl here --n4041b5, of course, they put together some real cute songs,	###but they did the johnny angel.###they did johnny elway to that.###.###johnny elway.###.### and, and i was trying --n403b3e to get my son to sing that.###my husband was just having a fit### don't have him sing that song.###but, they, they do a lot of fun things.###i think football is, football is kind of a, a sport that i think you kind of, it --n403de7's hard not to like --n403e06 it.###because you know there's just,###.###well, there is so much about it to like --n40403f.###.###it's exciting.###.###you know it's so exciting.###.###yeah.###.
113475:14	we drive by some houses --n404bba everyday that --n404bc9 have big signs,	###yeah.###.###and when the cowboys won the superbowl here --n4041b5, of course, they put together some real cute songs,###and we all ran out and bought the records,###and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item.###.###yeah.###yeah,###they probabl-,### i, i wish i would have bought the tape when i was in, uh, te-, in colorado --n404486.###because, uh, i, i think about that a lot.###but, you know, when i first moved here --n404685 was when they, well, no, i guess it was about a year ago they did this.###this interstate seventy-five song. or whatever --n40484f it was --n40485e about central expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything.###.###uh-huh.###.###that was kind of a funny song###but they sure do,###it seems to me like they really love their cowboys here.###even when they were losing pitifully --n404ad9, you know, people still support them.
113793:23	and, uh, seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from, from that direction.	###so.###.###yeah.###well, i,### one, one thing that --n40116d really bothers me beyond, beyond cutting what they spend --n4011a0 is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up --n4011df paying taxes --n4011ee###and the, um, regular normal taxpayers are, you know paying such a large proportion of, of our personal income###.###uh-huh.###.###and then the, uh, corporate, you know, industries just don't seem --n401515 to not pay proportionally.###.###right.###.###i think that that would, would help a lot.###i guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things,###but i don't know.###it's just hard to, hard to take --n40180b and, you know, see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use --n401882.###.###uh-huh.###.
113850:63	if they were --n4032dd to take half of what they spend --n403300 on that and put it on some economic, you know, inter-, intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might.	###i don't ever expect --n402a24 to pay mine off before i die###so i guess why should the government --n402aee.###.###.###isn't,###that's the way they're thinking these days anyway --n402baa.###.###it seems, seems --n402c46 to be.### i, you know, i,###it really does bother me when i think about, you know, leaving our children with, with this sort of, uh, a national problem that we can't seem --n402def to find an, an answer to --n402e12 it --n402e1d, uh,###i don't know.###.### i, i don't think it ever will really.###i,###maybe if they ever get to the point### the biggest, you know, the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense.###.###right.###.###really.
113855:35	and i don't mind, uh, --n4035d3 paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to --n40360a.	###that's the way they're thinking these days anyway --n402baa.###.###it seems, seems --n402c46 to be.### i, you know, i,###it really does bother me when i think about, you know, leaving our children with, with this sort of, uh, a national problem that we can't seem --n402def to find an, an answer to --n402e12 it --n402e1d, uh,###i don't know.###.### i, i don't think it ever will really.###i,###maybe if they ever get to the point### the biggest, you know, the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense.###.###right.###.###really.###if they were --n4032dd to take half of what they spend --n403300 on that and put it on some economic, you know, inter-, intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might.###.###yeah.###.### i, i believe in --n403521 paying my share,
113957:66	man our cr-, our, uh, prisons are so crowded that, uh, they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set --n400da0 free within a year to two.	###there's no deterrent.###.###.###that's right.###there's just no deterrent.###.###that's right.###.###and so many of those kind of people, they got, they have a better life --n4005f7 in prison than they have on the street anyway###so, you know, unless they really make it rough on them that's not a, going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think --n4007d7.###.###especially not a federal prison.###.###right.###well, i don't know what oklahoma's laws are --n4009e4###but texas's i don't know are,###i don't know### it's, it's no one's f-,###i mean it's not the judge's fault i don't think --n400be5.###it's just the way the law is --n400ca4 down here.
114195:20	but some schools, some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to, uh, you know, areas economically, uh say less advantaged areas.	###.###yeah.###.### it's not, uh, you know it's not, uh,### maybe the, maybe it cou-, uh,###younger people feel like it's not open to them,###i don't know.###but it should be if it's not.###.###yeah.###uh, i suspect that the-, yeah, that, that, that that's not the thing. that they, that they don't feel it's open to them###it's just that they, uh, are more self-centered if you will and not, not considering, a voluntary mumblex,###.###yeah,###.###.###it is kind of an introspective time of life.###.###yeah.###.
114202:81	and, uh, they, they promote service on the part of the kids to, to, uh, some of those people.	###but it should be if it's not.###.###yeah.###uh, i suspect that the-, yeah, that, that, that that's not the thing. that they, that they don't feel it's open to them###it's just that they, uh, are more self-centered if you will and not, not considering, a voluntary mumblex,###.###yeah,###.###.###it is kind of an introspective time of life.###.###yeah.###.###but some schools, some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to, uh, you know, areas economically, uh say less advantaged areas.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
114209:86	and i, i think we need --n402d4b to, we need --n402d66 to try --n402d79 to figure out some way to, to turn that around --n402db4 that everybody,	###.###.###it is kind of an introspective time of life.###.###yeah.###.###but some schools, some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to, uh, you know, areas economically, uh say less advantaged areas.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, they, they promote service on the part of the kids to, to, uh, some of those people.###so at least that's a step in the right direction i guess --n4029d2.###.###yeah.###yeah.###and, uh, now i didn-, i don't know it di-,### i, i think you're right that that's not the, not the way that the society these days is going --n402bea,
114255:29	um, uh, i think there's some problems,	###uh, it --n403ab5 really is better --n403ac8 to give then to receive.###.###yeah,### i, i agree with that,### and, uh, and i, i, i don't know what, what --n403c9b has, what --n403cb2 has set it off or what###but i-, it, it certainly seems to me that, that, uh, uh, things in, in the last twenty-three years, uh, things hav-, have definitely gone towards, uh, very much the concentration on self and, and loss of, loss of perspective in terms,###.###.###so, what do you think --n1002a about it.###.###well, i found it --n100a5 interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in america and then went back and said, well, if there is a problem, what should we do --n10128 about it.###.###right.###.###.###yeah,###i guess that's so.###.###do you feel there's a problem with immigration in america.###.
114588:104	uh, because i, i need --n40273b to have it tuned, you know, tuned --n402766 up and i don't know, replace some of the belts.	###so i've been thinking, especially now is a good time to buy a car --n4020bd.###.###yeah.###.###go-,###because i can't, uh, i don't know if i want --n4021f5 to, you know, pay all these repairs now --n402224 to start --n402233 getting it fixed --n402246 when it's starting --n40225d to breakdown --n40226c.###.###yeah,###i don't want --n40245a to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is###and it's not worth it.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###yeah,###that's true.###i agree with you there.###.###yeah.###.###so i don't know,
114610:10	we get some killer winters up here in the mountains.	###the, uh, tires need --n402969 to be replaced --n40297c###and so i was thinking just a lot of money###i'm,### might as well buy me a new car for that.###.###yeah,###i got new tires last winter too###so i'm like, well, that's the last major purchase for this thing.###it's not worth it.###.###uh-huh.###well, you have --n402cee to, in pennsylvania,###boy, you have --n402d7d to really have your car winterized --n402d9c and stuff,###huh.###.###yeah.###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah,

116252:35	i, i think there are some areas where we, where we, uh, pretty well, you know, get our money's worth --n40028b,	###but, anyway, we're supposed --n40496b to be talking about boats,###so back to boats.###.###.###so, tell me the last time you went for a boat ride --n404a7f.###.###well, actually, i went, uh, --n404b41 canoeing down the brazos this weekend.###.###oh, my gosh, now that had --n404c05 to be, that's boating.###that had --n404cdb to have been fun.###.###it was fun,###it was fun.###.###.### are, are we paying too much in taxes,###and are we getting what we pay for --n4000cf.###what's your opinion --n40014a.###.###well, it's kind of a broad subject, uh,
116310:26	uh, there has --n401ccd to be some way, i think, to equalize education opportunities --n401d0c.	###.###and don't really respond to, uh, people who --n40175e write them and call them###and, uh, you know, unless they're in the limelight and under pressure.###so, yeah,###i think we get short changed --n401949 on that.###.###right,###that's very true.### what, what state do you live in --n401a40.###.###texas.###.###okay.###.###that's,###.###what do you think --n401b35 about robin hood.###.###well, i work for school district###and, uh, it's, it has hurt us a lot.

116538:9	uh, some,	###.###wow.###.###yeah,###so i think, i would like --n117c5 to go to arizona.###i mean, i was in phoenix in january, last january###but it was rainy and icky.###.###oh, really.###.###it was the coldest it's been --n119ca there ever in january, i think --n119f1.###it's very cold.###.###so, do you travel a lot###.###but, i would like --n11b5d to go to tempe.###.###or,###.###do we travel a lot.
116582:15	but we've had some pretty nice weather.	###my husband hasn't been to europe yet###and i'd like --n12233 to take him there.### and, but he's traveled all over the united states###and i haven't.###like, i haven't been down south.###i'd like --n1240f to go to new orleans.###have you been there.###.###i haven't.### where, where do you live --n12528.###.### we, i live in yakima, washington.###.###wow.###.###so it's cold and rainy today.###it's yucky.###.###um.###.
116717:11	i know some people that --n13f67 went to b y u.	###.###no,###i don't.###actually since i grew up in texas i've only been here about two years and have gone --n13b67 skiing about three times. a-, well, five times each season.###.###uh.###.###.###why did you move to utah --n13d0a.### you're going, oh, you are going to school. at b y u,###.###yeah,###i,###.###is that where b y u is --n13ea9.###.###uh-huh.###yep.###.###okay,
116940:96	well, maybe this thing with, with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps --n40373f to, to correct it.	###but i think that's real dangerous###and, uh, i don't know.###i try --n402ecd to tell my kids just, --n402eec just kind of be aware of what --n402f0f's around them, you know###and, if you see a situation that --n40305f looks like it could be trouble, just get out of it or call for help, whichever.###.###yes.###.###but, uh,###.###yeah,###well, you know, the call for help is what --n403253 scares me now because it, it just,###i don't know,###people just don't,###i don't know,###i can't say they don't care, because people just have --n403471 to care about another person.###.###yeah.###.###but it's that not getting involved --n403587, that impersonal --n40359a society, i think we live in --n4035c5 today.###.
117330:23	it ended up i got some furniture --n4027cc back that one of them had moved --n4027ef out or something.	###.###but he likes --n402084 to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling things --n4020c7.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, that's nice that it's not in your house.###.###it really is.###.###uh-huh.###.###because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own,###and i, you know, i wouldn't mind --n4023bf having,###and i at one time was going --n402484 to fix up when one of my daughters left --n4024af, a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff --n402526 --n40252d,###.###uh-huh.###.###but i, someone,###i don't know,
117354:63	i just still have need for the four bedrooms --n402eaf just having company from time to time. and some of them coming back home and things, you know.	###so i didn't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would.###.###well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that --n402a24 come home.###.###uh-huh.###.###and the other room we use --n402b26 as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come.###his parents come###and also the kids have friends who --n402c26 come and stay###.###uh-huh.###.###and so it seems like it's always used --n402ce0 as a bedroom.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, i still,###all three of my daughters are married,###but, i don't know,
117571:46	is, is this, is this one with some company that, that --n4021c6 services you and takes your calls and all that stuff.	###.###but, uh, we were, so, uh,###.### so, so you saw this happening in your neighborhood###and you figured it wouldn't happen to you.###.###sort of, yeah.###and i never did get a security system,###but since that happened, i certainly have.###.###yeah,###what kind of system do you have --n401e5b.###.###it's, uh, uh, i guess --n401ee5, excuse me, just a standard.###uh,, with the, uh, all the doors and the, uh, infrared thing, you know, motion detector.###.###uh-huh.###.### pre-, pretty standard.###.
117808:33	and, uh, --n401dc6 seeing as you've got some older children, i, i'm wondering, how did you handle that --n401e1d, when they were growing up --n401e3c.	###.###that's okay.###.###good morning,###a r e,###this is arlene lister.###it was just a recorded message, on our business phone anyway.###.###.###i'm sorry,### keep --n401706 going.###.###no,###it's okay.###uh, so that was the thing that i, i noticed --n4017de that, i know a lot of people, lot of friends that we have --n401831, they have a tendency to do the same thing.###and one of the things we try --n401a59 to do --n401a68 is we try --n401a7b to avoid --n401a8a doing that as much as possible. although it --n401ab5 really is very easy to do that type of thing. just plop them down in front of the t v and let them be, uh, entertained --n401b34 that way.###.###uh-huh.###.###.
117836:27	or uh, you know, you got some cartoons	###uh-huh.###.###uh, when my, my big kids were, were little --n4021db, uh, you know, ev-, ev-, all the mothers were home.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, the, the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around###and then when they felt like it --n4024c8, they went out --n4024df to play, you know when they were, were little like that --n40251a.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###and, uh, i, i think it's gotten, uh, very different.###when my second one was little --n402793, they were coming out with sesame street which he started --n4027c6 watching --n4027d1###.###right.###.###and, other than that, i mean, there was basically, there was not educational t v
118309:83	that's, y-, count your blessings because uh, it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves --n40036e.	###salt water or,###.###no###.###yeah.###.###just regular water.###.###.###okay,###is it mike.###.###yes.###.###do you repair your own car.###.###i try --n4000d1 to, whenever i can --n4000f4.###i've always been a, a, i guess a product of a handyman father.###.###well, i tell you what,
118608:28	so you ought --n402aa8 to be saving up some every month --n402acb to make up for all what they should be taking --n402afa out.	###if you make a hundred dollars, you pay ten percent,###if you make a million dollars, you pay ten percent.###.###yeah,###that's the way our state tax is --n4025d0 here.###i think it's pretty fair.###.###our state taxes are somewhat based --n4026d7 on the federal.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate --n402797.###.###oh.###.### so, and, and you withhold no matter what you do --n40287c,###they withhold what they're supposed --n40294d to --n40295c###and at the end of the year it's not enough.###.###oh, great,
118734:78	and, um, i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.	###.###i know.###.###but the school system's afraid of --n401043 getting sued --n401052 and, um, all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure --n401089 because of things like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###and, i also believe we don't, even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid###and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
118753:13	i think in some ways that --n401b6d they need --n401b7c to be more careful of the teachers that they hire --n401bab.	###.###and, um, i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.###.###yeah.###wasn't that what part of the lottery is going --n40167d to go for --n401690, if we approve it.###.###yes###.###.###supposedly that's what it's suppose --n4017a7 to go for --n4017ba,###and you know, we'll just have --n401878 to wait and see whether that's approved --n40189f or not.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###you know, i don't know your feelings toward that.###i guess we shouldn't get into that### but, um, and what else, um,###.###.
118769:33	i've, i've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers	###i guess we shouldn't get into that### but, um, and what else, um,###.###.###i think in some ways that --n401b6d they need --n401b7c to be more careful of the teachers that they hire --n401bab.###.###uh-huh.###.###i have heard stories --n401cb8, uh, from other parents that i know of --n401ce7, their children are in high school that teachers are out there --n401d1e giving drugs and selling drugs,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###no.###really.###.###oh, yeah,###.###ooh.###.
118955:17	these, some of these young kids you read about --n4024d0, --n4024df just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all	###that's,###i thi-,###i agree,###i think that's where it stems from --n401fff, is that###and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that --n4020ee are working nowadays that --n402105 aren't home with the children###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right###and,###.###and that may impact it as well.###.###i think so,### and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.###.###right,###right.###.
119004:13	i was watching some show the other day,	###i'm the one,###.###himself and her.###.###yeah,###that must have been at least fifty years ago or more,###but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing --n40302d in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks###.###oh, wow,###.###.###i bet.###.###but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in texas###.###oh, i know,###.###it's just, you know, another killing.###.###well, they were,
119054:7	and some boy she tried --n4040e2 to get rid --n4040f5 of --n404100, he was like in his twenties,	###oh duh, duh, duh you know,###.###right.###.###.###i know,###how we mumblex and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible --n403acc,###.###yeah.###.###so, uh, that story i just told you --n403bdd about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in arlington, when was it --n403c34, i think it was, oh, it was --n403c67 almost a year ago in december to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with --n403cb6.###.###is that right.###.###yeah,###i think it was on a hard copy,###she was a real attractive blond girl, in, in her freshman year of college###.###uh-huh.###.
119099:68	and, uh, the police are not going --n4048df to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime.	###taco bueno,###right,###uh-huh.###.###and he just shot them himself and her.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###i remember --n40470c seeing that.###.###yeah, uh, uh,###isn't that weird.###.###yeah,###there's just too many crazy people out there these days.###.###i know,
119111:78	uh, i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know.	###.###yeah, uh, uh,###isn't that weird.###.###yeah,###there's just too many crazy people out there these days.###.###i know,###and, uh, the police are not going --n4048df to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime.###you know, he was just begging her on the phone,###that's not doing anything.###.###yeah.###.###and there are times i think, gee, i mumblex should give my kids gu-,###.###.###well, what --n40001e do you know --n400031 about latin american policies.###.###well, i think they're kind of ambivalent, really.
119144:63	and uh,, you know, of course i, i'm sure we have some enemies down there who --n4013b0 wouldn't care what --n4013c7 happened to us,	###.###but,###.### that, that's just it.###.###it's got --n4009bc to be tough,###but, i mean, uh, uh, you sure, you still have --n400a63 to, you know, let them know how you feel --n400a96.###.###right,###i guess my concern,###you know, no matter which, no matter which side we take --n400c6c, we're going --n400c83 to have supporters###and we're going --n400d96 to have, uh, antisupporters --n400db5, i guess --n400dcc, for lack of better term,###and, uh, like you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound --n400f09 to upset somebody,###but we seem --n400ff5 to be lacking the ability to take a stance.###.###yeah,###it --n4010cd worries me that, uh, the economy of so many countries in, in south america and central america depend on something that --n401140 damages people, like the, you know, like cocaine from columbia,###.###right.###.
119161:71	and, uh, we, we dabble in it just enough --n401b6d to make both sides angry at us some how, some times,	###.###right.###.###and uh,, you know, of course i, i'm sure we have some enemies down there who --n4013b0 wouldn't care what --n4013c7 happened to us,###.###right.###.### but but that is, that's a tough deal,###.###that's true.###.###and it,###i don't think that,### maybe i, maybe it's, you know, i'm reflecting how i feel --n40170b about it,###but i have a feeling that we, that we really don't understand basically the, the, the competing factions in lot of those countries###and i mean, they've been hammering mumblex, for the last, you know, ten centuries,###.###sure.###.###and it's still going on,
119161:79	and, uh, we, we dabble in it just enough --n401b6d to make both sides angry at us some how, some times,	###.###right.###.###and uh,, you know, of course i, i'm sure we have some enemies down there who --n4013b0 wouldn't care what --n4013c7 happened to us,###.###right.###.### but but that is, that's a tough deal,###.###that's true.###.###and it,###i don't think that,### maybe i, maybe it's, you know, i'm reflecting how i feel --n40170b about it,###but i have a feeling that we, that we really don't understand basically the, the, the competing factions in lot of those countries###and i mean, they've been hammering mumblex, for the last, you know, ten centuries,###.###sure.###.###and it's still going on,
119377:10	but maybe some day they can get closer,	###he's admissions director.###.###.###uh. university of texas in dallas.###.###oh, okay###.###yeah.###.###it's just north of me here.###.###yeah,###well that's, he's got a job there###and this is his first year,###so, it's been a real interesting thing for them.###.###that's great.###.###but they seem --n401e51 to like it okay.###i think they're too far away from me,
119842:10	we bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for christmas,	###uh,###.###right,###just to get you by five years###and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed --n401192###.###yeah.###.### we're, we're a wasteful society, for sure.###.###well, that's true,###and lot of times though, it is, it --n40135b costs so much --n40136e to get something fixed --n401389 that you almost are just as well off --n4013b0 buying another one you know, if it's,###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###.###and you usually get what you pay for --n4015d2.
119945:93	and i think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something --n403e4c and, you know, had some pride in it --n403e7b.	###.### ye-, i think technology is better,### i'm, i'm not sure.###i think you've got a good point with the plastic and that.###.###about quality.###.###i don't think necessarily that, things are being made --n403adf better uh, you know,###.###right.###.### i, i,###everything is so automated, uh,###and things --n403c76 can be made --n403c89 without, i think a human hand ever touching it, you know an awful lot of things,###.###yeah,###.###.###yeah.###.
119996:58	but i'm ready --n401381 to have a president --n401398 elected --n4013a3 that --n4013ae at least has some sort of a domestic agenda,	###.###absolutely.###.###oh, so how about the soviet union.###what do you think --n400a90's going --n400a9f to happen there.###the break ups.###.###i think that's great.###um, i'm glad --n400be0 to see that,###but i, again, i don't want --n400c87 to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the soviet union without a, uh, well, uh, a whole lot under any circumstances because i, i don't know, i'm, i'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more --n400d8a to them than if you give it to them,###and so, i'm, i'm not much in favor of it,###but i'm glad --n4011b0 to see us advising them###.###uh-huh.###.###that doesn't seem --n401261 to cost a whole lot of money.###.###that's right,###that's right.###.
120178:18	um uh, well, some of both.	###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, other than that, uh, i just, you know,###just the events that --n400ee1 happen around the world interest me.### stay in touch with it and know, feel like i know what --n400fb1's going on.###.###yeah.###.###now i have --n4010cc to say all three of my children, none of them are too interested in current events.###.###i see.###.###but i always have been###.###uh-huh.###.###and i stay up with it.###but, uh, how do you, how do you, uh, stay aware of most of the current events --n40133c.###uh, newspaper. t v news, or what.###.
120254:15	i've read some things about him that he was, he wasn't too good himself.	###they've just been so terribly mistreated --n40204c for so many, many years, you know. i mean, through papa doc,###.###that's true.###.###.###they've never really had a good leader,###.###i mean he was a terrible tyrant###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i think it's been better since he died,###but it's still been bad###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, even that priest that --n402401 was in control there for a while that they overthrew --n402430, uh,
120455:20	and they had, uh, some names, some companies that --n401bd6 sold mustang parts,	###but it was fun.###i really enjoyed it.###.###well, how'd you learn --n401587 to do that to fix them up --n4015aa.###.###oh, you just,###.###you just get a book that --n4016ae tells you how to do it --n4016d1 or what.###.###no,###you just kind of,###all i did --n401813 is, uh, i bought the car###and then, uh, you know, you can,###i, uh, was just in a supermarket###and i seen a, a magazine for, you know,###basically it, it was called --n401a96 mustang magazine### and and so i bought it###.###uh-huh.###.
120455:28	and they had, uh, some names, some companies that --n401bd6 sold mustang parts,	###but it was fun.###i really enjoyed it.###.###well, how'd you learn --n401587 to do that to fix them up --n4015aa.###.###oh, you just,###.###you just get a book that --n4016ae tells you how to do it --n4016d1 or what.###.###no,###you just kind of,###all i did --n401813 is, uh, i bought the car###and then, uh, you know, you can,###i, uh, was just in a supermarket###and i seen a, a magazine for, you know,###basically it, it was called --n401a96 mustang magazine### and and so i bought it###.###uh-huh.###.
120456:22	and i just started --n401c8a ordering some parts	###i really enjoyed it.###.###well, how'd you learn --n401587 to do that to fix them up --n4015aa.###.###oh, you just,###.###you just get a book that --n4016ae tells you how to do it --n4016d1 or what.###.###no,###you just kind of,###all i did --n401813 is, uh, i bought the car###and then, uh, you know, you can,###i, uh, was just in a supermarket###and i seen a, a magazine for, you know,###basically it, it was called --n401a96 mustang magazine### and and so i bought it###.###uh-huh.###.###and they had, uh, some names, some companies that --n401bd6 sold mustang parts,
120517:9	or do some of them play the same song.	###.###so. let's see,###what else.###i started --n402afc collecting music boxes.###i guess that's a hobby.###.###yeah###that is.###.###so.###.###that's interesting.###how many music boxes do you have --n402c87.###.###probably o-, uh, about twenty.###.###do they all play different songs###.###uh-huh.###.
120597:11	and, maybe some day.	###i bet.###.###everything was like an hour or two hours at the louvre, you know, things like that where you need the whole day --n40411b,### but but it really,###.###right.###.###.###that's where a camcorder would come in handy --n4042b4.###.###exactly,###that's true.###.###well that sounds real neat.###so you, you haven't been back to europe since then, huh.###.###no,###i always thought i would,###but who --n404538 knows now.###i got married --n404593
120747:13	something giving you some affection as well.	###.###uh-huh.###.###so,###.###right,###but i suppose it --n401b92 was still in the instinct of them to to back up and get ready.###.###right.###.###.###one other question we had --n401d04 is, why do you have pets --n401d27.###.###yeah,###why, i don't know --n401e00,### i, i think they're kind of nice to have --n401e85,###they're kind of, you know, just relaxing to, i don't know, to pet --n401fa1 and to,###i don't know,###when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that --n402131, just kind of enjoyable to, you know, have --n40216c like,###i don't know,
120849:17	um, tell me some about your camping experiences, carolyn.	###and my husband, then fianc3e, was --n403905 to keep my cat,###and he let her out,###and my house was loaded with fleas,###i mean, you walked in###and your legs were just black.###.###really.###.###and we had such a time, and never got the cat back.###.###really.###.###yeah,###i found it, you know, in the street.###.###oh.###.###i was a social worker at the time, and found it,###.###.
120873:46	and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning,	###okay.###.###and, uh, i enjoy camping.###i,### we ha-, we have a tent,###and we've gone, even with our family a few times out --n400363 camping and have a camp stove, um,###i guess our, our, my biggest memory is when we froze to death --n400485.###.###.###we just didn't take enough blankets and whatever.###.### wh-, where do you go --n400608 camping at --n400617 around here.###.###.###uh, we went --n4006d6 camping at, uh, lake bonham, which --n400701 is, is pretty close here. um,###we went fairly early in the season for this area, which --n400843 is probably april is when we went --n400866,###.###okay.###.### and, and it got really cold at night,
120922:61	but by then, of course, i was able --n4021b1 to catch, uh, catch some things,	###and hopefully we'd catch our supper,###but we never did###.###um.###.###but it was, it was always fun.###we'd always,###mom was always prepared###and she'd bring along, you know, something, because tradition had it we would never catch anything,###so we always had, something --n401b79 along to eat --n401b94,###.###.###but then we'd roast, roast marshmallows,###and it, it was always an enjoyable experience.###uh, about nineteen eighty-two i moved from rapid city in the black hills,###i crossed the state to, to aberdeen,###and, uh, there's no hills,###it's flat,###and then i was in high school,###and, uh, couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and i, we'd go --n401fe0 camping out by a river, of course, and, and go --n40201b fishing,
121023:37	saint augustine, uh with a little bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas	###yeah,###i'm still trying --n404093 to find my way around.### i, if i can get on central from anywhere, i'm happy.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###well, really the ideal times to camp in this area --n404267 are early spring, and, in, in the fall.###.###okay.###.###it just gets so hot --n4043b9 in the summer you can hardly,###i mean, there's, there's a lot,###.###.###okay,###well what do you do --n400040 on your yard.###.###well, uh, typical lawn stuff.
121141:6	and some people call them may beetles.	###.###yeah###we found them.###we dug under there about an inch###and you could see them.###they're real fat little white things,###and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###those kind of brown, uh, ju-, what we call june bugs --n4024ee###.###yeah,### but in, but in the,###.###.###uh-huh.###.
121148:22	they said that every yard has some	###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###those kind of brown, uh, ju-, what we call june bugs --n4024ee###.###yeah,### but in, but in the,###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and some people call them may beetles.###.###yeah,###june bugs is what i'd heard them called --n4026eb --n4026f2,###.###.###so any how, occasionally i find them in the flower beds.
121156:16	well, i had some of that problem,	### but in, but in the,###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and some people call them may beetles.###.###yeah,###june bugs is what i'd heard them called --n4026eb --n4026f2,###.###.###so any how, occasionally i find them in the flower beds.###they said that every yard has some###.###uh, yeah.###.###but it was a preponderance of them that --n4028d3 caused our problem.###so that's the number one thing we do --n40298d, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned --n4029c8 so badly before.###.###yeah,
121336:58	but, uh, somebody, somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying --n400afc, it's not that we mind --n400b1f paying taxes, it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government.	###i had zucchini and, and yellow crook neck squash,###.###.###uh, i guess --n400026 my personal opinion, i, i don't mind --n400055 paying taxes necessarily.### i, i just sometimes wonder if our money is being used --n40016e in the best way.###.###right.###.###uh, sometimes when i hear what, what they're, even what, even what the politicians are making --n4002c6 --n4002cd, you know, when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that --n400318, uh, i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them --n40036b, uh,###and that's all tax money.###when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much --n4006b0, it's just billions of dollars###that's, i think --n4007b4 is just being thrown --n4007cb away.###.###right,###right.###and then when you read about that --n4008b4 they're spending all the money on, you know, these studies that --n4008f3 have no relevance whatsoever,###that kind of ticks you off, too.###.###yeah.###.
121569:26	i just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back.	###so that was a long time ago.###i used --n401e04 to watch it, was in high school and college when laura's mother got killed --n401e4b --n401e52.###.###right.###.###she was my favorite character on there.###.###.###i just,###i read the reason she got, they, they killed her off --n402045 was because they couldn't settle a contract,###and i said, well, if they're going --n4021c7 to do that to her, i won't watch it.###.###oh, that's great.###well, i do like all my children,### and i, and i like it, you know,###i don't know.###i just,###i like the people on it, i guess --n4024c5, you know.###.### i, i, i like it.
121609:20	now she's married to some guy in new york,	###.###yeah,###cliff's on the young and the restless now.###.###oh, he is.###so he's out for good.###.###yeah,###he's out for good.###.###did they marry.###.###uh###.###nina and cliff.###.###that's how they left the show --n402eda, but not in real life.###.###um.###.

122706:39	where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses --n4029f8	###our governor that --n4021d1 just got thrown --n4021e4 out of office was trying --n4021ff to be real big on education###but he wasn't.###.###yeah.###.###and a lot of his problems had --n402368 to do with money mostly.###i know a lot, a lot of,###if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, unfortunately, there's not many places to get that money --n4025e6.###.###yeah.###.###then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different mumblex,###i know one of my physics professors at college has addressed this.###that most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level aren't scientists,###they're teachers.###and they may not know a lot about what they're teaching --n402929.
122792:22	well, if you play with some consistency though, you can get it right back down.	###you do tend --n4006b4 to, forget.###.###no.###.###.###well, i'm one of those rare left-handed golfers.###.###oh.###yeah.###.###and i do enjoy --n4007fa playing.###.###what is your handicap --n40085e.###.###right now it's three.###.###okay.###uh, i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago.###it's probably up there to twenty now if i mumblex to start again.###.

123034:17	i know maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh,	###uh-huh,###yeah,###i've h-, seen him before.###.###.### wh-, i-, what would we do --n401bb7 without it..###.###yeah.### yo-, we were talking about that just the other day.###what did we do --n401d4e without it back then.###.###yeah.###.###i guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,### there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that --n401f36 have come up.
123090:44	i think, uh, it --n40358d's in everyone's nature to some degree to want --n4035c0 to get out and explore something they haven't --n4035f3, or experience something, you know, indifferent.	###yeah.###but,###.###but, uh, yeah,###i would like --n402e31 to see them, uh, do more in that area --n402e68 to make space travel more, uh, something that the ordinary person can, uh, en-, enjoy --n402ebf.###.###yeah.### i know it's i think it --n403082's in people's nature to be the first --n4030b5 to do something.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i, i'd love --n403233 to be the first one --n403252 to step on a planet or some like, you know,###.###yeah.###yeah,###me too.###i wouldn't even mind --n403413 being not so much being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore.###.###yeah.###.
123102:14	there must be some better so-, better way of doing this.	###.###yeah.###yeah,###me too.###i wouldn't even mind --n403413 being not so much being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore.###.###yeah.###.###i think, uh, it --n40358d's in everyone's nature to some degree to want --n4035c0 to get out and explore something they haven't --n4035f3, or experience something, you know, indifferent.###.###huh.###.###.###i think that's what --n4037da made us, uh, progress to the state we are --n403811 is our curiosity.###.###oh, sure.###sure.###of course.###that's true.###.
123419:8	and some paper or something in the super dome up in the roof caught on fire.	###yeah,###the saints are starting --n400bd5 to impress me this year, you know, a lot.###.###boy,### they are, they are just a fun team to watch --n400ced.###.### this, it, they are really.###did you see the game sunday night or, sunday afternoon.###.###uh, no,###.###.###i didn't.###.###it was funny.### there were, they ha-, uh, a fireworks display at halftime.###.###oh, yeah.###.###yeah,
123589:12	and there's some other city.	###well,###.###well, do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing --n4036bd in.###.### to tell you the truth i haven't paid too much attention to that.###.###really.###.###um, what cities are they looking at --n403890.###.###uh, right now i think this memphis, they're, they're trying --n40392f to get the teams.###.###uh-huh.###.###and that's, that's where i was --n403a63 when i saw, uh, houston play --n403a8a.###.###uh-huh.###.###saint louis is trying --n403ba6 to get a team.###uh, baltimore is trying --n403c2f to get a team,
123605:25	i'd like --n4040fd to see some more teams get in.	###uh-huh.###.###saint louis is trying --n403ba6 to get a team.###uh, baltimore is trying --n403c2f to get a team,###and there's some other city.###i'm wanting --n403d08 to say raleigh durham###but i'm not sure.###.###you know, i think you are right.###i think it is raleigh.###.### think so.###.###i think i remember --n403f0a hearing that.###.###uh-huh.###because i know they've got a mumblex football team###but i think it might be them.###.###that would be fun.
123714:38	we're supposed --n402046 to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, uh, which --n402099 will be, you know, a little bit more typical, uh, autumn weather.	###it's really strange.###.###yeah,###i think we usually have a frost in october.###.###yeah.###.###uh, but, you know. we really need the rain that we've been getting --n401a89,###and it has not today,###but the last few days it's been, been pouring most of the day.###.### is it, is it, is it flooding anywhere.###.###flooding anywhere.###i have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere,###i mean, that's occurred --n401e5a certainly at times in the past,###but, uh, no,###i've not heard of any particular problems this time.###.###it's just kind of, uh, clou-,
123761:34	so you, you all actually had some color, huh.	###.###and, uh, i was up there last weekend,###and there are trees that, that --n402b63 still have their leaves on,###and they're green,###but they're dead.###you know, the, the freeze just got them.###.###mumblex.###.### they, they weren't ready for it at all apparently,### and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all.###not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all.###really weird this year.###i'm not sure what that, what that means --n402fc8.###.###i don't know.###yeah,###our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now.###i think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.###.
123797:41	i was up, i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend,	###gorgeous.###that's, you know,###i think you could drive along in maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the, and the pines and what not,###and you could, you know, you could be driving along in east texas###and looks just the same.###it's almost, you know, identical kind of country.###.###uh-huh.###.###beautiful.###.###been that this year for the trees for the leaves.###.###yeah.###.###.###oh.###.###.###yeah,
123812:31	uh, it, there's some trees like the oaks,	###.###oh.###.###.###yeah,### i was up, i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend,###so.###.###um.###.### little, little oak tree that --n403b18 was dead, and cut it up and split it mumblex.###.###yeah,###that's because it, it can't tolerate a freeze this early.###is that right.###.###well.###.###if it would came later it would be all right.###.
123916:50	i don't know who --n400fa4 played when and who --n400fbb does what like some guys are.	###yeah.###have you ever been to a cowboy's game.###.###i haven't,###huh-uh.###.###um, it's pretty nice.###.### we dec-, we decided --n400d32 just to watch them at home.###.###.###but.###.###that's good.###at least you, uh, follow the game a little bit.###.###yeah.###.###um, yeah,###i'm not a fanatic about it.
124072:24	and maybe we'll meet up again some time.	###so if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that, that'd be the place to do it --n402f14.###.###yeah,###my brother-in-law, um, is in the medical profession##, i mean, he's at medical scho-, school in san antonio right now.###.###oh, great.###.###so.###.###great.###.###yeah.###.###well, like i said, good luck to you.###.###thanks.###.###all right,###well, um, take care,
124385:34	but now i, i do like some of these, uh, brighter, fluorescent colors.	###.###.###uh-huh,###definitely.###.###.###towards each other.###.###yeah,### i, i, i know a lot of the things that, that we wear, men wear --n402568 nowadays were, would have been considered --n40258f, uh, feminine, uh, many years ago,###but. i know, it's been, it was hard for me at first,###.###uh-huh,###yeah.###.###but now i kind of like, you know, a lot of the bright colors.###.###yeah.###.###i mean, like i used --n4029ed to be more, uh, conservative and just your basic colors,
124416:8	maybe some day	###.###yeah.### i, i, i guess the, the best thing --n402ea5 i like --n402eb8 to see --n402ec7 from the sixties and seventies is, of course, is the mini skirt, of course.###one of the nice things,###.###.###but, uh,###yeah,###i don't think that there's anything as original,### it's, it's all based --n40320e on, uh, one of the past styles,###they just, um, make their, uh, circle and come back again.###.###yeah.###.###so if you hang onto your clothes long enough, uh they'll, they'll be back in style in a few years.###.###yeah.###.###.###that's true,
124500:45	my son and i used --n401316 to have a bet --n40132d going about some of the players that --n401350 had moved from here to minnesota,	###and so everybody was a twins fan,###and i was kind of, uh, didn't have much interest in the twins, you know,### it was, it was kind of pathetic##, i mean, we only had two radio stations,###and one of them broadcast every twins game live, you know,### and, and the other one was country.###.###so you didn't really have a lot of choice, did you.###.###so, that's right.###.###.###there's was twins --n400f59 there, or, you know skip williams.###.###or country.###.###.###yeah.###oh, uh, and i was routing for the twins myself because, uh, they, a couple of ranger players that i had watched --n4010b5 when we first moved here --n4010d0, uh, went to minnesota,###and we used --n401285 to tease about,
124592:15	you know, some of the,	###you know, and he said, i get a kick out of it, you know,### he's, he's such a nice man.###.###well, didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the rangers.###.###yeah,###and he, you know###when he quits at --n402f23 being active --n402f32, he will go into, you know being a, managing and, yeah, you know, being a coach, i'm sure --n402fa9.###.###management.###.###.###right.###.###but, he's, uh, he certainly is a good example, uh, for the kids.###.###that's right.###.###you know, you like --n4032ba to have someone like that you could point to --n4032e9 say, see what a fine man, that, he is --n403324.###.
124653:71	it's hurting, you know, it's hurting germany --n400656, for example, too, and some other parts of europe where they, where they have high industry --n4006ad.	###well, the rangers really, uh, knocked the socks off of them, which you would expect --n4041d1 you know, anyway,###.###right.###.###but nolan i think --n4042f5 took himself out after a couple of innings --n40431c or something, you know, of the game###so,###.###.###okay.###.###so what do you, uh, think --n400050 is the, uh, the worst culprit for air pollution.###.###well, i think it's, it's probably a combination of things.###um, factories that, that --n400271 burn coal as a, an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants, you know,###and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, those are the ones i think --n40046f primarily contribute to acid rain,###and i think that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit.
124760:28	that might help a little bit, especially in some places.	###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, they've had catalytic con-, you know, catalytic converters on those, on,###uh, i think they're required --n4026dd in california and oregon and, and washington,###but they've had up those for quite a while,###and somebody's come up with a new one that, uh, --n402864 sort of,### it's a, it's a catalytic converter,### it's, it's a plate that --n4029d1 fits in, you know, into the smoke pipe###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, apparently it sort of feeds itself.###the more smoke --n402ba0 is produced --n402baf, you know,###after you get to like five hundred degrees, the higher it gets --n402c84 the more complete the combustion is --n402ca3.###and it sounds real neat.###i haven't seen them priced --n402de0 anywhere yet,###but that, that sounds like that might help --n402e83 solve that problem even on you know, old, old, uh, older stoves that --n402eda don't have any kind of e p a requirements on them.###.###yeah.###.
124787:54	i really think, uh, you know, we're doing some, some important things.	###especially in, in, uh, autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us,###but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well.###.###yeah.###.###probably blowing up there to you guys.###.###yeah,###well, well around here i, we get, uh,###well it depends, you know,###either in the, in the winter time it, it blows it your way,###and in the summer time we probably get yours.###.###yeah.###.###.###it comes back.###.###.###yeah.
125063:17	and then, um, some other credit cards, like store credit cards, you know, i do have them up there a little bit,	###uh, like, uh, my car, uh, had a major problem,######and###seven hundred dollars,###.###uh-huh.###.###and uh, things just come up###.###right,###right.###.###and you just never get --n400c90 to use it the way you'd really like --n400cbf to --n400cce.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###well, actually i do have quite a few more credit cards than you have.###um, and i use them, you know,###like my american express i use --n400f53 for, you know, gas, things like that,###and i pay that off monthly,
125143:30	so that i use --n4022c1, because i travel some.	###.###right,###right.###well, well that's great.###um, everyone i know --n401dd0 here uses, um, credit cards like they're going out of business to be honest with you.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,### it's, it --n401f77's just too easy, basically, uh, just get yourself in trouble with those.###.###yeah,###yeah.###yeah,###the only other one i have --n40212a,###i have like a diner's club through my, um, where i work --n4021cc###.###i see.###.
125609:16	i've just received some.	### i, i, i didn't pick it, uh###.###oh, you didn't.###.###i mean, um, i, like i don't really recall.###i may have filled out on the, on the form,###but i, i certainly, certainly have the feeling i've been given --n40309e topics different from the ones that i mentioned --n4030c5 before.###.###oh, did you.###see, i haven't placed any calls.###did they automatically assign the topic.###.###yes,###yes,###when you place a call --n403350 topic is given --n403363 to you.###.###oh, i didn't know that.###.###.###i thought whoever --n403469 made the call could choose what topic, because i haven't made any calls yet.
125651:10	um, some of the qualifications that i look for --n4007c2 was that, uh, you know, the cost, and, um, exactly what they did --n400815, if it was structured or nonstructured, if they had a little academic, um, uh, in there, and, um, you know, um, you know, what the qualifications of the teachers' were --n4008c4, and if the place was clean and um, the hours	###this is laurie,###and i'm in garland.###.###oh, okay.###um, would you like me to go first.###.###sure.###.###okay, um###i have three children, um, two, two who --n4002ad are in regular school, uh, eleven year old, an eight year old,###and then my little one, three year old, is in, um, a university of gymnastics,###it's a, a preschool###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, i think it --n400564 was really hard to, um, to pick the right, uh, day care or preschool or mother's day out.###i guess you can classify them all together.###.###uh-huh.###.
125789:80	some, some places, um, start them as early as, i think, well, some, some places take them as infants, i guess --n403c0a, you know, like eight weeks, even.	###yeah.###we're pretty excited.###.###i bet.### that's, that's wonderful.###.###yeah,###but that, you know, we have been thinking about that,###but it's a little ways off in the future###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, i figure, you know, i'd probably start --n4038c0 asking around at church because i know they have a limit as to how old they can be --n403913 before they, you know, before you can bring them in.###.###asking.###.###.###right.###.###.
125794:78	a friend of mine who --n403ef7's a nurse is, was telling about a wonderful new place that --n403f3e opened some place in, on fifteenth street,	###.###yeah,###but that, you know, we have been thinking about that,###but it's a little ways off in the future###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, i figure, you know, i'd probably start --n4038c0 asking around at church because i know they have a limit as to how old they can be --n403913 before they, you know, before you can bring them in.###.###asking.###.###.###right.###.###.### some, some places, um, start them as early as, i think, well, some, some places take them as infants, i guess --n403c0a, you know, like eight weeks, even.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, there's a place to look into --n403e2f, um, um,
125802:14	you know, some places just specialize in just real little ones	###.###asking.###.###.###right.###.###.### some, some places, um, start them as early as, i think, well, some, some places take them as infants, i guess --n403c0a, you know, like eight weeks, even.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, there's a place to look into --n403e2f, um, um,###a friend of mine who --n403ef7's a nurse is, was telling about a wonderful new place that --n403f3e opened some place in, on fifteenth street,###up,###it's in plano somewhere where, um,###nurses that --n40414b used --n404156 to work in the hospital take care of infants, infants and then only up to like two years old###.###um.###.###and it's, it's supposed --n40430f to be really a, a,
125857:6	and some days he doesn't,	###i've sort of stopped here with the weather change,###but, uh, it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning.###.###uh-huh,###every morning.###well, my husband swims every day at lunch, which he loves --n40093f doing --n40094a###.###oh, that would,###that's fantastic exercise.###.###yeah,###he does it every day like a ritual.###once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he, um, someone invites him to lunch, he'll, he'll not go,###but he goes, um, every, every day,###and then he ru-, he's a runner, too.###he runs three mornings a week###he gets up about five and, and does his, his deal,###.###um.###.
125888:43	i think you feel better, too, if you get on some program like that,	###.###oh.###.###.### the, the, the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here,###and i know, um, uh, we, we both of, my husband and i both do it --n4015ef to just keep the pounds off.###we're getting up in age, i guess, in our late thirties###so we need --n401830 to keep --n40183f exercising --n40184a just to be able --n401861 to, uh.###.###yeah.###.###.###it keeps --n401952 going,###because i'm fifty-five,###and it, uh, it just gets worse.###you still want --n401a84 to eat,### and, uh but you just,###.###oh, i know.###.
125903:18	but um, there are some parts during that exercise that i think, i can not do another second of this --n4020ef.	###you still want --n401a84 to eat,### and, uh but you just,###.###oh, i know.###.###i think you feel better, too, if you get on some program like that,###but, uh.###.###yeah,###i go to this aerobics class two mornings a week,###and i take my three year old with me.###there's a nursery there.###and it's kind of another day out for her to, um, have little friends,###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, i, i enjoy the socialization of it, you know, --n401f46 getting --n401f51 to see the same women every morning,###.###right.###.
125908:50	i know it, it, it, some of it is so tough	###i think you feel better, too, if you get on some program like that,###but, uh.###.###yeah,###i go to this aerobics class two mornings a week,###and i take my three year old with me.###there's a nursery there.###and it's kind of another day out for her to, um, have little friends,###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, i, i enjoy the socialization of it, you know, --n401f46 getting --n401f51 to see the same women every morning,###.###right.###.###but um, there are some parts during that exercise that i think, i can not do another second of this --n4020ef.###.###oh.###.###.
126092:77	next, next car i get --n4043ec's going --n4043fb to be a four door --n404416 too. something with some room.	###well, when our kids were younger --n4038d2 we really wanted a two door.###our first car was an oldsmobile back in seventy-seven.###it was a two door cutlass supreme,###and, uh, it --n403a62 just happened that when we looked for our, our new car --n403a99, they had a thing going with oldsmobile###and if you'd buy a, a new oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred rebate, because it was their seventy-fifth anniversary.###.###uh-huh.###.###i belie-,###yeah###seventy-fifth anniversary.###so in addition to everything else we got --n403dbb off the car, all we had --n403de2 to do --n403df1 is show them our, uh, papers on our first car,###and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it.###so we, we got a four door this time,###and i sort of went more for the, uh, the comfort factor,###and, uh, i liked the smaller cars,###but i'm a bigger person,###and i, i really like comfort, you know, --n40426b driving along the road and stuff.###.###well, that's another big factor of mine.
126165:57	i've got where now i can hit it in, in the air some of the time --n401919.	###i like that too.###.###uh, well, i, i, i, if i can, i can hit a great deal like, um, they, they, my friends###.###i don't know###i try --n401042 to play,###but god, i, a couple years ago i played two, three times a week and got lousy.###i guess that's the best i ever got --n4011d1 was lousy.###and i thought i was really improving and the big break was going --n4012c1 to come###and then i got worse again###so.###.### to get me they, they say i hit worm burners because i, i can't hit it up in the air.###.###yeah.###.###so i'm pretty bad###but i, i, i get great distance --n401612 hitting it, you know, mumblex across the ground,###and if it's going over water or something one of them have --n401766 to take the shot for me because i'm,###but i'm getting better.
126181:103	well, that i, i guess that's what i need --n401fdf to do --n401fee is, is get some kind of lessons or something.	###so i'm pretty bad###but i, i, i get great distance --n401612 hitting it, you know, mumblex across the ground,###and if it's going over water or something one of them have --n401766 to take the shot for me because i'm,###but i'm getting better.###i've got where now i can hit it in, in the air some of the time --n401919.###.###that's pretty good.###.###yeah.###uh, so i'm kind of a novice at it.###.###um, i'm that and worse.### i, i play###next year i,###actually i take it kind of seriously###but i've been doing so bad.### next year, i always say this every year, but next year i'm starting over from scratch.###i'm going --n401dcb to go --n401dda take lessons and everything.###i'm going --n401e7f to do it right, and see if i can actually play this game or not.###.
126348:16	i guess in some cases they just consider --n4006ba pickup your, your phone and, and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not.	###uh-huh.###.###uh, what --n400115 most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things.###.###uh-huh.###.###all, sorts of hours calling and telling me that i want investment advise and i want this service and that service or the other thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yes.###i hate those canned messages they put --n4003e4 on my recorder.###.###um, my sense is that something may just have been done --n4004a6 about it by congressmen mumblex###just what --n400571 went into the mumblex###something about the random dialers that --n4005ef just dial phone numbers.###.###uh-huh.###.
126352:41	um, but i thought i saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using	###uh-huh.###.###all, sorts of hours calling and telling me that i want investment advise and i want this service and that service or the other thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yes.###i hate those canned messages they put --n4003e4 on my recorder.###.###um, my sense is that something may just have been done --n4004a6 about it by congressmen mumblex###just what --n400571 went into the mumblex###something about the random dialers that --n4005ef just dial phone numbers.###.###uh-huh.###.###i guess in some cases they just consider --n4006ba pickup your, your phone and, and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not.###.###uh-huh.###.
126361:10	uh, some of mumblex did too.	###.###um, my sense is that something may just have been done --n4004a6 about it by congressmen mumblex###just what --n400571 went into the mumblex###something about the random dialers that --n4005ef just dial phone numbers.###.###uh-huh.###.###i guess in some cases they just consider --n4006ba pickup your, your phone and, and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, but i thought i saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using### and, uh, and, uh, people, businesses would be prohibited --n400ad2, uh, from --n400ae9 calling for pers-, for, for business mumblex selling you things.###.###i have through, the phone company, uh,###.###i'm sure that's true.###.###no nine hundred numbers can be dialed --n400db1 from my phone or received --n400dcc.###.
126455:10	uh, some of that unfortunately is legal.	###.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and companies can purchase this list###and what that is --n402699 is people who --n4026ac buy from the mail.###.###yeah,###and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers.###.###uh-huh.###.###i'll be thinking in mind the address is,###um, is there anything you can do --n402904 about that like give out a phony phone number.###.###uh, no.###.###.###not really.###um, no.
126460:28	but is it a legal, uh, solution for some companies.	###and what that is --n402699 is people who --n4026ac buy from the mail.###.###yeah,###and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers.###.###uh-huh.###.###i'll be thinking in mind the address is,###um, is there anything you can do --n402904 about that like give out a phony phone number.###.###uh, no.###.###.###not really.###um, no.###uh, some of that unfortunately is legal.###so they can't stop people from, uh, --n402b20 advertising### and that, and that's what it falls under --n402bb9.###it falls under the guise of advertising.###so, i don't care for it,
126604:16	som-, some kids are so spoiled nowadays	###but i, i guess i don't feel like it should be something forced upon you.###.###yeah,###well it, it probably won't.###.###uh-huh.###.### i don't, i don't even know how we'd pay for it --n401981 anyway.###we can't, uh seem --n401a71 to pay for all the little things we have --n401aa0 going now.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's another consideration.###.###exactly.###.###but, uh, i don't know
126632:62	sometimes i wish we'd help them out instead of --n40255f going all across the world, and helping some countries i never even heard of --n4025a6.	###they're just kind of shocked at that side of town, you know.###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.###i probably lived in one of those when i was a little girl --n40202a.###.###i have a girlfriend that every time her son starts --n4020f4 taking things for granted --n40210b --n402112 she threatens --n402121 to send him to mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while.###.###oh.###well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it.###.###wouldn't it though.###.###i mean right next to us is --n402428 such a pitiful country.###.###uh-huh,###it is.###.###i know.
126761:25	e-, even in some families some people talk a little bit different.	###i've had the same experiences,###.###uh-huh.###.###all right around here.###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah,###i don't know, uh,###i wonder if they really,###i don't know if they could possibly teach a machine --n403d84 to recognize all the different accents.###.###.### there's just, there's so many with this one town you know.###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.###.
126761:30	e-, even in some families some people talk a little bit different.	###i've had the same experiences,###.###uh-huh.###.###all right around here.###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah,###i don't know, uh,###i wonder if they really,###i don't know if they could possibly teach a machine --n403d84 to recognize all the different accents.###.###.### there's just, there's so many with this one town you know.###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.###.
127011:17	i can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students i see --n13425 over at the medical school.	###we rent a lot of movies###so we, we often sit around and say, what movies should we rent --n12f1f.###.###.###and we don't know.###.###well if you, if you can get green card, go for it.###.###all right,###we'll try that one.###.###i have been working at, uh, as an accountant at the medical school here in dallas###and i have watched, uh, gross anatomy.###have you seen that one.###.###yeah,###i did.###.###okay.###and i don't know
127097:33	but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that i would have --n40113b to put on a suit --n401156. for a customer presentation or something.	###so, does it change.###.###no.###.###your dress,###no.###.###no,###huh-uh.###.### so, or, i guess,###do you have things like presentations --n400ea1 --n400eac to do --n400ebb or anything like that.###.###no,###huh-uh.###.###so, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty i would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like,###.###uh-huh.###.
127169:7	and some of these mini skirts, you know, are worse than shorts ever thought about --n402307 being.	###.### mi-, middle of the road.###.###it --n401edd's nice that there's not a requirement for it.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###.###sometimes i think there should be.###some of these women around here look like they came off of harry hines.###.###oh, yeah,###right.###.###.###yeah,###i guess you see those once in a while.###.###and you know the, they have the no shorts deal,
127350:66	i've, i've heard they're, i hear you have some problems.	###.### sounds to me like they'll start --n4022ec rioting soon, or not that that would do any good,###but i guess people do that when they're desperate --n402412.###.### that, that's true, uh,### hasn't happened here for a while,###but it, uh,###.###well, that's true,###since the depression, i guess when the veterans went to washington --n402650###.###uh-huh.###.###and well, you know, the war riots, of course.### let's just hope we don't get to that point.###.###.###things are not so good in texas job wise.###.###no,
127456:31	oh, i, i know some of the people.	###well, i think so, too.### i, i just, admire her a lot.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, i ho-, i really hope she does well.###but she's, uh, n-, you know, probably more popular --n40491f out of the state than she is here, although she did manage --n40495e to win.###.###right.###.###but look who she was running against --n404aef, you know.###.###well, yeah,###anybody could beat claytie in texas.###.###he shot himself in the foot so many times.###.###.###how did you get on this t i thing --n404cc2.###.
127596:32	i've, i've done some water exercises,	###a friend of mine, uh, suggested swimming as --n402a11 being the best exercise there is --n402a34.###.###right.###.###.###right,###i used --n402b35 to do a lot of swimming,### we have, we have a swimming pool,###but it's an old concrete pool.###we've been having trouble with it the past few years,###so we haven't got --n402d48 to use it much,###but i love --n402dd2 to swim and water ski and stuff like that.###.###the, uh, swimming, they say --n402ea3, uses more muscles than any other exercise with,###and the water takes the resistance.###.###right.###.###right,###and you don't get the soreness.
127608:33	you don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees --n403337, go out to the swimming pool.	###.###the, uh, swimming, they say --n402ea3, uses more muscles than any other exercise with,###and the water takes the resistance.###.###right.###.###right,###and you don't get the soreness.### i've, i've done some water exercises,###but our pool is not, is not heated --n403112###so it's,###.###right,###you can't do it year round.###.###summertime only.###.###right,###that's the way ours is --n403299.###.
127761:15	not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into --n402257.	###yeah,### my last, right, my last chance to win ten million dollars,###so i figured, hey, look.###for twelve dollars, you know,###.###well, i, i, i went ahead and sent in my subscription --n401f27 because of that uh, to, uh, entertainment.###.###.###that's it.###.###.###oh, yeah,###oh, uh-huh.###.###and i was real disappointed with it.###.###yeah.###.### i, i don't know,###it just,
127919:39	so i don't, i don't know some of those shows now, like i used --n4011b2 to.	###speakera24-1*t24-1.###they're pretty young.###speakerbnan*t24-1.###speakerb24-2*t24-2.### and, uh, so we usually catch, uh, full house,###and, uh, what's the one --n400fc0 comes on after that --n400fd7.###speakeranan*t24-2.###speakerb25-1*t25-1.###it's a new one, uh,,###speakeranan*t25-1.###speakera25-2*t25-2.###i don't know,###speakerbnan*t25-2.###.###my kids are older###.###speakerb28-1*t28-1.###uh-huh.###speakeranan*t28-1.###speakera28-2*t28-2.
128104:24	i mean, they'll have some things --n40312a in there that --n40313d almost, almost, you know, like supernatural, or something, you know,	###we started --n402dcc watching northern exposure.###well, it's not really new,###but it's still kind of new.###speakerbnan*t68-1.###speakerb68-2*t68-2.###uh-huh,###speakeranan*t68-2.###speakera69-1*t69-1.###uh-huh.###speakerbnan*t69-1.###speakerb69-2*t69-2.###how's that --n402f2c.###i haven't seen that.###speakeranan*t69-2.###.###i like it a lot.###.###it's real different.###in fact, they never thought it would be a hit.###huh.
128305:9	occasionally, some ice skating will come on, on a sunday or during the olympics	###speakeranan*t131-1.###speakera131-2*t131-2.### says he,###speakerbnan*t131-2.###.###or,###.###no,###i don't care anything about that.###.###because i don't either.### i can't, i can't watch it on t v,###.###speakerb135-1*t135-1.###so###speakeranan*t135-1.###speakera135-2*t135-2.###i like the ice skating, you know,###speakerbnan*t135-2.###.
128489:17	but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning, just like brushing your teeth you're going --n4039ec to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour.	###.###well, that's why chuck, i think, uh, if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things, you know, where you can make excuses like --n403448 --n40344f,###.###.###yeah.###.###well, i, i like biking###and during the summer, i'll do, you know, at least seventy-five miles a week and when i really was doing it --n4036d5 maybe a hundred and fifty,###.###uh-huh.###.###but you can't, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###there's excuses, weather###.###yep.###.###or you don't have time or something like that.
128628:26	and then you go --n400834 to read some order book or something	###but, uh, i sense that it's not going --n400363 to happen anytime soon.###.###yeah,###i don't think it's going --n400445 to happen either,###but i wish it were###because i'm a, i got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering.###.###uh-huh.###.###i'm at grad school now in acoustics###and all we do --n4006b1 is metric stuff.###.###you're now in what.###.###acoustics.###.###acoustics, uh.###.###yeah,###so everything's metric
128636:30	uh, i suppose things, some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught --n400b92 in the schools more to the extent that that's happening, having a new generation --n400bdd come up that --n400bf0's more used to it.	###.###i'm at grad school now in acoustics###and all we do --n4006b1 is metric stuff.###.###you're now in what.###.###acoustics.###.###acoustics, uh.###.###yeah,###so everything's metric###and then you go --n400834 to read some order book or something###and it's all confusing###so i don't understand as much,###so i think we should get one adopted --n40098a permanently.###.###well, i guess that is the policy,###but it's been the policy for a long time###and nothing ever happens.
128696:11	they have some of those in ohio.	###and you, you make more mistakes --n40256c --n402573 doing all the conversions than you would --n40259a doing the problems.###mumblex just get one.###i prefer metric,###but even if it's english, they should just have one.###.###well, i mean, unfortunate-, i think people like you --n4027ea are relatively rare who --n402801 are coming up against this problem every day.###.###yeah,###yeah,###i think so.### your, your average guy jogging down the highway wants --n4029c4 to know how many miles --n4029df it is --n4029ee to his destination.###.###uh, i mean, there are things you could do --n402b2e.###uh, we have signs --n402be3 up on the n i s t campus here, speed limit twenty-five miles per hour, forty kilometers per hour.###.###yeah.###.###uh, but that hasn't been adopted --n402d60 very widely.###.###yeah,
129004:16	but, did they have some pretty good special effects.	###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###well, you know, he was rear admiral, whatever, you know,###and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow.###vulcans age a lot better.###.###well, yeah,###he didn't look too bad, did he.###.###no,###huh-uh.###matter of fact, he looks just as about as old --n40161c and the, uh, next generation as he does in the latest star trek.### imagine that.###.###yeah,###that's amazing.###.###.
129083:10	they have some good management principals in this new generation.	###.###it was crowded.###.###not in a crowd like that.###.###.###huh-uh.###.###no.###.###it was like, uh, want an autograph, want --n40264a to stand in line for about four hours.###.###yeah.###.###.###wow.###.###it was a pretty crowded place.###.###huh.
129171:26	what do you feel --n400040 are some of the main problems.	###yeah,###he was just kind of walking around.###.###didn't he used --n403b4f to.###.###not really.###he was always in the box before.###.###oh.###.###.###oh, that's, yeah, that's, okay.###.###yeah.###.###yeah,###that's what i was thinking --n403d4a.###.###.###okay,
129179:18	uh, in dallas, some of the major problems, uh,	###oh.###.###.###oh, that's, yeah, that's, okay.###.###yeah.###.###yeah,###that's what i was thinking --n403d4a.###.###.###okay,###what do you feel --n400040 are some of the main problems.###.###well, i'm in a, i'm in an urban area.###i'm in dallas.###.###uh-huh.###.###and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem, uh, even a more major problem.
129583:26	i'm going --n403828 to look into some other fields.	###.###so, but, i'll be here a long time, at this rate.###.###what's your major --n4034d1.###.###uh, it was nursing,###but i'm in the process of changing it right now.###.###uh-huh,###oh.###.###because it's really, really competitive at b y u.###.###yeah.###.###you have --n4036e3 to have like a three seven --n403702 to get in###so, it's really,###.###that's true.###.
129960:42	and, uh, so we've done that for quite some time,	###.###well, lots, right.###.###right.###.###finally.###.###really,### what, what do you do --n4001f8, now.###.###well, we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the, uh, boy scouts our boys have been involved --n4002e0 in --n4002eb have, uh, had a huge recycling bin, over at resurrection lutheran church###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
129990:36	although just, just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, uh, --n400b22 work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs.	###so now we just put ours out for the city of plano.###do you live in plano.###.###yes,###i do.###.###okay,###yeah.###.###yeah,###and i'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins --n4009bf.###.###right.###.###have you had yours now.###.###yes.###.###yeah.###.
126610:15	and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes	###.### i don't, i don't even know how we'd pay for it --n401981 anyway.###we can't, uh seem --n401a71 to pay for all the little things we have --n401aa0 going now.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's another consideration.###.###exactly.###.###but, uh, i don't know### som-, some kids are so spoiled nowadays###it might be a real eye opener, you know.###.###really.###.###i mean, sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here
130028:54	i do news, mostly newspapers and, uh, plastic two liter diet coke bottles. and aluminum cans some,	###yeah,###we used --n401131 to take ours there.###.###and, uh###.###.###my garage was just getting overwhelmed --n4011e3.###.###i know.###.###and, of course, i didn't go weekly,###so it became quite a big thing,###.###right.###.###and, uh,###.###right,###i'm really glad they do it.###uh, yeah,
130065:25	well, i guess there are some places, uh, in the north, in particular that, uh, --n401ec9 have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle	###so it was wasting a lot of time.###yeah.###.### wasting all your time and effort and, putting it in there.###.###.### thinking i was safe in --n401b73 buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned --n401ba2.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###but, uh, you know, but it, it's not that hard now that i've got this system under control.###.### got your routine down.###.###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.
130087:11	what are some of the things they don't recycle --n402650 --n402657.	###.###uh, uh-huh.###.###so if you recycle things, of course, then you don't have all that weight in there.###.###yeah,###i do find that i don't have as much to throw --n4022d3 away because all the bulky things are, are being tossed --n402306 in with the recycling.###.###right.###.###.###that's right.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, i don't know what they could do more of --n40251c exactly around here right now other than, uh,
130276:4	some people,	###right.###.###and everybody knows exactly what, what for --n40154f.###.###right.###.###uh, and, you know, and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact,### or, or there is a good chance you're going --n401876 to get off.###.###uh-huh.###and also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm,###i mean, sure, their life is taken --n401a29,###but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway,###so i think sometimes they'd prefer --n401b5a just to get it over with###.###uh-huh.###yeah,###.###so it's more of the easy way out than making them pay for the con-, for the you know, what they've done --n401cad.###.
130514:28	and i mostly went to germany and visited some friends of my family and, uh, hung out with them, worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp.	###with the eastern half that's the dominican republic.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i was down there with a program from the college that i went to --n400eb7 where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country, most of them third world countries. and study the language and then do a little service project --n400f3a.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###um.###.###so, yeah,###that turned out --n401154 to be a really good experience for me.###.###so, what did you do --n401212 when you were in europe --n40122d.###.###uh, well, see, i went there when i was in high school --n4012fe, actually###.###uh-huh.###.
130584:43	uh, the closest thing i did --n402557 was go to some like, uh, restored castles and stuff.	###.###cooking class, you know,###french cooking.###.###oh, great.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, what else are you planning --n402239 to do --n402248, if anything.###.###museums, you know,### go to museums and,###.###uh-huh.###yeah, um,###.###do you go to museums in europe.###.###uh, actually, no,###i don't think i went to any of them.
130588:25	that, there is some on that west coast of france	###oh, great.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, what else are you planning --n402239 to do --n402248, if anything.###.###museums, you know,### go to museums and,###.###uh-huh.###yeah, um,###.###do you go to museums in europe.###.###uh, actually, no,###i don't think i went to any of them.###uh, the closest thing i did --n402557 was go to some like, uh, restored castles and stuff.###.###um.###.
130755:109	what, what --n4025f3 really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e-, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it --n4026a2 --n4026a9, you know what i mean --n4026c8, then people tend --n4026df to do it.	###yeah.###.###but they, they said they can't be smashed or else, uh, it doesn't fit in their little containers###and they're not reimbursed --n402091 by the, the people who --n4020b0 are over them or something.###.###well, shoot, maybe what we ought --n4021bb to do --n4021ca is --n4021d5 start --n4021e0 sending unsmashed, uh, pepsi cans and whatever up there.###.###yeah.###.###.###exactly,###yeah,### send it to this address,###no.###.###.###but, uh, let's see,###they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, uh,###.### i, i, i tell you
130776:48	and, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass --n402e92 on to the consumer, you know,	###uh,###.###yeah,###that's,###.###in other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good###.###uh-huh.###.###but if it's going --n402b0c to cost you --n402b1f to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh likely --n402b62 to do it as if, uh, if you get something back for it. you know.###.###as likely to do it.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###that's true.###.
130776:68	and, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass --n402e92 on to the consumer, you know,	###uh,###.###yeah,###that's,###.###in other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good###.###uh-huh.###.###but if it's going --n402b0c to cost you --n402b1f to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh likely --n402b62 to do it as if, uh, if you get something back for it. you know.###.###as likely to do it.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###that's true.###.
130807:72	and one way that we do it sort of in, in iowa --n403b93 is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops.	###yeah,###exactly.###.###you know.###but, uh, i know we had a problem down here with, uh, oil, people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the d-, you know, the s-, the drain sewer.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, all that, because there was,###apparently a lot of people, you know, every time they change the oil --n403711, they just dump all the res-, their old oil down there.###.###uh-huh.###.###now they're starting --n403897 to recycle that stuff.###.###oh, that's good.###uh, another thing i thought of --n403980, i guess, --n40399b to recycle --n4039aa would be like clothes, because i mean everybody gets rid --n4039dd of their clothes sometime or other.
130921:15	well, we have some very nice hou-, homes here in this area.	### i, i probably do know,###.###uh, you,###.###but i don't know it by that name.###.###this is pretty well where l b j and audelia, skillman cross --n4012c8.###.###okay.###.###.###sure.###.###we're just north of, uh, white rock lake.###.###oh, okay,###yeah,###i know that area.###that's a nice area.###.
130958:7	but some of those are pretty big.	###how about you.###.###well, i am, uh, i'm, gosh, i'm barely in dallas.###i'm just north of addison airport up on the tollway.###.###okay.###.###.###okay.###.###and, i guess we have a similar situation.###i mean, we've got houses two streets away that --n401ddb are probably around seventy, eighty thousand###.###uh-huh.###.###and then we've got bent tree right across the street###so i don't i don't even know how high those go --n401f8c,###.###okay.###.
130994:39	and, i guess he, he did some crazy thing --n402b21 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal.	###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###i've noticed that.###.###well, now, do you live in a, a home, or zero lot home,###.###uh-huh.###.###or,###.###uh, we've got a house,### let's see,###we moved in about four years ago###and it was, it had previously been unoccupied,###but it had existed for three years.###.###okay.###.###this is a whole block of homes that, uh, a builder built all of --n402a32 them
130994:56	and, i guess he, he did some crazy thing --n402b21 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal.	###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###i've noticed that.###.###well, now, do you live in a, a home, or zero lot home,###.###uh-huh.###.###or,###.###uh, we've got a house,### let's see,###we moved in about four years ago###and it was, it had previously been unoccupied,###but it had existed for three years.###.###okay.###.###this is a whole block of homes that, uh, a builder built all of --n402a32 them
131001:13	and, so, some were vacant for quite a while before they, you know, they finally sold them because there were so many.	###uh-huh.###.###or,###.###uh, we've got a house,### let's see,###we moved in about four years ago###and it was, it had previously been unoccupied,###but it had existed for three years.###.###okay.###.###this is a whole block of homes that, uh, a builder built all of --n402a32 them###and, i guess he, he did some crazy thing --n402b21 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal.###.###.###so the whole block was all foreclosed --n402c99.###.###oh.###.
131089:18	well, we do to some degree	###.###i'm sorry.###.###it increases each year i think --n10598.###.###it sure does.###yeah,###there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays.###.###well, and i think women have kind of had, uh, in the past the real subservient role.###.###role.###.###.###right.###.###and, uh,###.###that's changing.###.
131277:37	so, uh, it --n13c80 would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that	### is, is that what you're talking about --n137a7, women working out of their homes.###.###right.###.###yeah,###uh, i think it's wonderful.###.###right.###you only have --n13966 to check in with the office once or twice a week###and,###.###yeah.###.###course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going --n13a86 to be able --n13a99 to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that,###.###oh, i kn-,###.###.###by the phone and all that.###.
131278:6	and some ways, it might be kind of scary.	###.###right.###.###yeah,###uh, i think it's wonderful.###.###right.###you only have --n13966 to check in with the office once or twice a week###and,###.###yeah.###.###course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going --n13a86 to be able --n13a99 to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that,###.###oh, i kn-,###.###.###by the phone and all that.###.###so, uh, it --n13c80 would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that
131517:11	especially in some of these schools around here, i think they have about twenty percent older students.	###oh, they do. especially if they, if they're meant --n402d91 to, i think --n402db0.###.###yeah.###.###.###well, i certainly hope so.###.###i mean, i've got a daughter that --n402f41's a sophomore at u t###and i'm, i'm going to u t a right now myself###so it's never too late.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, it's, oh, i agree it's never too late.###.###right.###.###and,###.
131523:14	i've seen some people that --n403494 are really quite up there you know	###.###i mean, i've got a daughter that --n402f41's a sophomore at u t###and i'm, i'm going to u t a right now myself###so it's never too late.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, it's, oh, i agree it's never too late.###.###right.###.###and,###.###especially in some of these schools around here, i think they have about twenty percent older students.###.###yeah,###and when you're saying older --n403395, we're talking fifty up.###.###oh, yeah,
131630:33	are going --n404ce9 to have --n404cf8 to solve some of the problem, huh.	###.###.###i was going --n40494a to say the same thing.###.###schools are not able --n4049d3 to###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and between a person's religion, uh, their, their faith in their maker w-, whether, you know, uh, whether you're christian or jewish or whatever, uh,###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###and the family###.
131722:36	i probably need --n401dbf to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current and, uh, and practice more often.	###but, uh i just, i just never could do it.###.###.###i have a brother-in-law who --n40168a is, uh, an ex-college coach and like a pro###and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf###sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family.###.###well, i went to,###i decided this past year that i was going --n4018cc to get out and start --n4018e7 playing a lot more###and i, i went after it###and did, and i really didn't find much improvement.###fact, ever time i'd start --n401aff trying --n401b0a to correct something --n401b1d, it seemed like the score would go, go back up,###.###oh, really.###.###yeah,### i, i think i need --n401ceb to, uh,###.###yeah.###.
132148:16	and there's probably some truth to that.	###yeah.###.###huh, well,###.###.###okay,###what do you think --n40003c about, uh, the self insurance business.###.###well, i watched something on t v --n4000ed a couple of months ago by, uh, general, ex, uh, surgeon general koop.###.###uh-huh.###.###and he talked about canada's system###and it appears --n4002b4 to work fine for the normal colds and things like that,###but the expensive stuff, heart, uh, operations and things, they have a managed scarcity.###and they said that in canada, there were as many heart, uh, trauma centers as there is in san francisco.###so in one city of, in america, there's as many, uh, hospitals that --n4005c3 are equipped --n4005d2 to do hosp-, uh, heart operations as in the entire area of canada,###and that's kind of spooky.###.###well, i, uh, i understand what you're saying --n400818,
132391:25	like, try --n402449 to get some place and exercise from five to six,	###i don't have --n401cff to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i just go###and we, uh, exercise.###and until then, you know i have belonged to exercise clubs###and oh i have gone to, uh, oh, like, uh, oh, these gyms, you know that the, like in plano and richardson and, uh, where they offer the, uh, rec centers really where they offer aerobics --n401fc5###.###uh-huh.###.###and i have done that before,###but it has always had --n40224a to be late at night after i have got home and after dinner###.###yeah.###.###and you are just kind of going ugh.###.###.###and i have tried it immediately after school
132402:20	well, i know, some people go during lunch,	###and i have done that before,###but it has always had --n40224a to be late at night after i have got home and after dinner###.###yeah.###.###and you are just kind of going ugh.###.###.###and i have tried it immediately after school###like, try --n402449 to get some place and exercise from five to six,###but then by the time you get home and you get dinner --n402546 you are eating so late.###.###that is right.###that is right.###that is a mumblex.###.###it is.###it is really hard with our life style when you work --n40274a to,###.###uh-huh.
132454:18	it beats memberships at some of these clubs.	###in fact, she charges us two dollars a session.###.###well, that is not much.###.###huh-uh.###so it's, it's,###we like pay her for six weeks at a time cause that is like a unit in, uh, uh, school uh, report card period###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks.###.###oh.###that is not bad.###.###huh-uh.###.
132696:166	and then you just dip the carcass in, uh, boiling water, pull it out, and there's a, we use a little raspy brush, --n401362 pulls the hair off, and, uh, gut it, and, uh, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, uh, some pineapple, about three pineapples, you know, sliced them up, and, uh, cover him up with, uh, wet, uh, sacks, feed sacks is what i usually use --n40147d and then start a charcoal fire on top of him.	###well, no,###hey, i tell you what,### preparing a little pig is, is a snap,###.###.###i'm telling you,###real easy, easier than chicken.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah,###you just, uh,###you kill him, you know,###you probably,###most guys just shoot them in the head,###they go, you know,###in a second they're gone###.###oh.###.

132933:5	some of the cars that i got --n4013fe were like the toyota camry and the nissan maxima and some of the competitors	###but we just bought another used car, a couple weeks ago, actually.###.###uh-huh,###yeah###me too.###.###.###so what car do you drive --n40106c.###what is it --n4010cb.###.###uh, mine is a honda accord.###.###uh-huh,###we almost bought one of those.###do you like it.###.###yeah,###i do,###and, and, um, it's funny because, after i bought it, i was doing a lot of business --n4012ca traveling,###and i,
132933:57	some of the cars that i got --n4013fe were like the toyota camry and the nissan maxima and some of the competitors	###but we just bought another used car, a couple weeks ago, actually.###.###uh-huh,###yeah###me too.###.###.###so what car do you drive --n40106c.###what is it --n4010cb.###.###uh, mine is a honda accord.###.###uh-huh,###we almost bought one of those.###do you like it.###.###yeah,###i do,###and, and, um, it's funny because, after i bought it, i was doing a lot of business --n4012ca traveling,###and i,
133013:23	um, and it really saved us some big money once.	###t i,###i see.###.###.###uh-huh.###um,###but yeah,### i, i, uh, i don't know,###i would probably, if i were --n40225d to buy a car mys-, you know, with the constraints of real money i probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a honda accord.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###maybe it would,###one thing i, i really liked --n402572 about, about the dodge daytona is the fact that they have, uh, this seven year warranty.###.###oh, really.###.
133228:13	i certainly have some ideas since i'm studying it now in college.	###that a little town or, or a bigger city.###.###um, it's not one of the bigger ones.###it's probably, um,###i compare it to the size of plano,###maybe a little smaller.###plano, texas.###.###oh.###i talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town, i think --n40033a --n400341.###.###oh, really.###no.###.###yeah,###i forgot the name of the town.###i thought maybe it was you.###.###.###oh, well, anyway, we're supposed --n400583 to talk about education.
133358:40	but i do think that we have --n403663 to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five, six grades and just keep --n4036be going over and over and over until most of those that --n4036f1 are capable can at least learn --n403710 to read and write	###right.###.###but, uh. we actually rank --n402ea8 forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes, you know.###.###um.###.### that's, that's pretty low that there's forty-eight countries --n403017 ahead of us that --n40302e have more peop-, more citizens --n40304d percentage wise that --n403060 can read and write,###.###yeah.###.###so, um, unless we want --n403225 to keep --n403234 paying, paying for these people that --n403257 can't make it in society, we're going --n403286 to have --n403295 to do something.###.###who do you think it should be done --n40344a through --n403455..###uh-huh.###.###i don't know.###obviously nobody's smart enough --n403554 to have figured it out yet,###so i probably can't.###.###.
133518:49	well, it went pretty well, uh, other than the fact that we encountered some, uh, problems that you run across --n40027c in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another --n4002b3,	### and then they and then the people default on the loans.###.###and then they don't provide very much education.###.###.###yes.###.###well, i would have --n4041eb to agree with you if there are circumstances like that, uh, around, uh,###and i, i, i can't confess to --n404339 having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing,### but, but --n404461 taking what you're saying --n40447c at face value, then i would have --n4044a3 to agree with completely.###.###yeah.###.###.###you've done.###.###our most recent series of projects i guess --n400074, was, inside was, uh, we remodeled a bathroom recently.###.###well, how did it go --n4001c5.###.
134021:50	and i think that it's, it's very surprising some of these very expensive volvos can be gotten --n403642 for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing --n40367d to buy ones that --n403694 are about, the vintage of the cars that you and i currently own --n4036d3	###yes,###it just, just sits there and purrs,###and you, all you got --n403183 to do --n403192 is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter.###i get six hundred miles on a tank of gas.###.###oh, i know.###it's really amazing.###.###yeah.###.###it's, uh,,###.###beautiful, beautiful machine.###.###absolutely,###.###.###incredible.###so, um, yeah,###anyway, i've been looking at the prices of these cars and, and so forth,
134033:13	well, certainly some of the top end ones.	###beautiful, beautiful machine.###.###absolutely,###.###.###incredible.###so, um, yeah,###anyway, i've been looking at the prices of these cars and, and so forth,###and i think that it's, it's very surprising some of these very expensive volvos can be gotten --n403642 for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing --n40367d to buy ones that --n403694 are about, the vintage of the cars that you and i currently own --n4036d3###.###is that right,###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um,###.###well, a brand new volvo costs, what, thirty thousand dollars.###.
134101:49	uh, the state of wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against illinois because of the air pollution we were getting --n4008c3.	###.###and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze, uh coming up along the lake.###.###that's horrible.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they do post, uh, uh, warnings for people who --n4005af have, uh, heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season.###.###uh-huh.###.###in the winter it's not as severe.###.###right.###.###but, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad.###.###uh-huh.###.
134169:64	maybe to you and i who --n4023f4 have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, i think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware --n40249f, uh, rather quickly of, of what --n4024d6's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is --n402519.	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and there is a, a real promotion of, of biking###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, there are still a lot of people who --n402096 insist on, on --n4020ad driving their own automobiles uh, --n4020cc to go everywhere.###.###right.###.###i find that a little irritating, because i don't think it's always so necessary.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah,### it, it becomes, uh,
134176:40	and we'll let them try --n402b1b to drink out of some of the lakes and try --n402b4a to fish in some of the lakes that --n402b71 have been suffering from, uh, the, uh, acid rain	###.###but, um, there are still a lot of people who --n402096 insist on, on --n4020ad driving their own automobiles uh, --n4020cc to go everywhere.###.###right.###.###i find that a little irritating, because i don't think it's always so necessary.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah,### it, it becomes, uh,###maybe to you and i who --n4023f4 have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, i think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware --n40249f, uh, rather quickly of, of what --n4024d6's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is --n402519.###um, i, i notice people in, in dallas seem --n402816 to say, well, sure, there's air pollution,###but, you know, really, how bad is, how bad could this problem really be --n4029b2.###.### send, send them to wisconsin,###.###.
134176:70	and we'll let them try --n402b1b to drink out of some of the lakes and try --n402b4a to fish in some of the lakes that --n402b71 have been suffering from, uh, the, uh, acid rain	###.###but, um, there are still a lot of people who --n402096 insist on, on --n4020ad driving their own automobiles uh, --n4020cc to go everywhere.###.###right.###.###i find that a little irritating, because i don't think it's always so necessary.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah,### it, it becomes, uh,###maybe to you and i who --n4023f4 have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, i think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware --n40249f, uh, rather quickly of, of what --n4024d6's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is --n402519.###um, i, i notice people in, in dallas seem --n402816 to say, well, sure, there's air pollution,###but, you know, really, how bad is, how bad could this problem really be --n4029b2.###.### send, send them to wisconsin,###.###.
134199:41	i think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of, of the gary area	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they'll, they'll, they may wake up, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###how'd you like --n402ea2 to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain --n402ee9 --n402ef0.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###it's, uh, really a serious issue for those of us up in this, uh, sector up, up here.###.### do you find that, um, or, or do you hypothesize that, that most of the, uh, smog or, or air pollution comes from vehicles###or does it come mostly from industry up there.###.
134228:135	but, i, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um, --n400217 taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,	###uh-huh.###.###that causes the acid rain.###that i'm a little uncertain of --n403774,###but i do know that, uh, it is a problem.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###i had talked with my parents.### i, i grew up, uh, i was born --n40393c in, uh, muncie, indiana, and, and grew up a little bit in terre haute,###and i had asked them before, uh,###i went back --n403b63 to visit recently, about a year ago,###and i asked them,###i said, did you ever realize the air pollution that --n403c70 was,###.###.### let's see,###my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,
134300:47	i think, um, i was thinking about --n4017d9 throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets	###.###the rest of it is just like wild flowers###.###wild flowers.###.###and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.###.###uh-huh.###.###they're about, oh, i guess --n40151f, a third the size of your, palm of your hand###.###uh-huh.###.###and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and indian paintbrush.###.###oh, that sounds lovely.###.###.###uh-huh.###oh, the wild flowers are beautiful.

135381:35	to me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories.	###it --n400464's funny how many names --n40047f have been used --n400492, uh, all over the country.###.###yeah,###well, tell me what kind of books have you read --n4005b7.###.###well, to tell you the truth, i've been going to college for the last four years###so mainly, text books.###.###.###i was going --n40078a to say, not fun kind, right.###.###no,###um,###but, i, i really tend --n400871 to like biographies a lot, not necessarily always heavy ones###.###uh-huh.###.###but, you know, sometimes biogr-,###i just read one about grace kelley.###i love --n400a5a to read about real people.

135453:35	i know, uh, the bri-, some of the british people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty.	###.###yeah,###i think it was by her, now that you mention it, because someone had given it to me,###and i thought, well, this will be great,###and it was.###.###yeah,###i've heard that she's done real-, you know, her books are really interesting,###and they always sell well.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh,###.###well, when you use real people like that --n401e13, i think royalty, especially, you know.###.###yeah,### brings it to life.###.###.

136396:82	thing is, we've, uh, the main thing that we've had --n402706 with this house recently has been some, uh, squirming, i call it, of the foundation.	###.###.###yeah,###yeah,###that would be just too much of a fall for me.###um, have you been, uh,### was, was the house reasonably new,###or you been doing some remodeling work on it.###.###it's actually just twelve years old, now.###.###that's pretty new house yet.###.###yeah,###it, uh,###this part of the country, actually, they say that when the house is, uh, fifteen --n40253f, it's already old,###but just take good care of it.###.###yeah.###.

136987:27	it's been because of the size or some problem like that.	###me too, uh,###me too.###unless i'm going somewhere warm for the winter.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###yeah,###that'd be nice.###.###where'd you,###.###.###mumblex return anything.###.###well, really, the only things that i have returned --n40007c have not been faulty,###.###.
137317:74	do they still have the, uh, the scenic, uh, roadways that --n401b88 cut through the center of some of those trees.	###like, sequoia national park.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh.###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###i had been there before when i lived in california --n4018c8,###but that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe.###.###yeah.###.###but, that is god's country,###it has --n401ab6 to be.###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.
137619:16	but they're doing some stomping on virginia.	###troy aikman,###he got hurt --n402f50 at o u,###so he transferred to u c l a.###.### well, well, he, he really didn't feel like he'd be able --n40305e to do a lot of passing at o u.###.###.###right.###.###o u has always been known --n4031e8 for their running game.###.###uh-huh.###.###more than,###.###they're playing tonight in fact.###.###right.###.###i'm watching them on t v right now.
137756:10	uh, some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north. the c d and the premium sound system.	###so i can, i can play those###and,###.###uh, was,###that wasn't a standard, p-, feature, was it.###.###uh-huh.###.###okay.###.###but there is not very many options on that car.###.###uh,###.###there is only about five or six options.###everything else is standard.###.###yeah,###you get the impression that,###.
137794:5	some of these muddy driveways could use it around here.	###this is a, uh, uh, probably suspension tied into the brakes.###.###.###yeah.###.###.### and, and also the suspension can be raised --n401739 for driving, like in the ice and snow.###it can raise the car's center up a little bit. for going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in michigan or somewhere.###.###um.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###uh, shoot###.### mississippi probably doesn't, mississippi probably doesn't have --n401a4a to worry too much.###.
137807:15	well, you had some there.	###.###.###yeah,###uh, shoot###.### mississippi probably doesn't, mississippi probably doesn't have --n401a4a to worry too much.###.###some of these muddy driveways could use it around here.###.###.###no,###snow doesn't happen very often.###.###if it does, people go, what's this stuff --n401c3a.###.###yeah,###uh, originally i'm from west virginia.###we got a pretty fair amount of snow.###.###oh,
138037:56	i think we need --n4025f1 to get back to the, show some respect	###.###and,###.###we wouldn't have thought of --n402143 crossing a teacher when we were in school --n40216a.###.###no.###.###.###heavens,###no.###.### wouldn't have thought of it### and and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe###.###no,###you wouldn't.###.###and,###.###and, uh, the things they can say and do --n402435 to a teacher and they do from what i understand --n402464, uh, i think that's wrong.
138110:35	so i think that maybe that's effected it to some degree.	###and it had --n403afa to be matching###and,###.###and when it was skirts --n403b8a, it was like, get down on the floor###and we hold the ruler up here###.###yes.###.###and it's no more than so many inches above the knee.###.###exactly.###.###.###yes.###.###because it was mini skirt time back there at one time.###.###yes,###so it's really changed.###it's, uh, really kind of gone the rounds,

138291:103	i'd, i'd kind of like --n403d01 to, to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say, a table saw and some of those things that --n403d70 would make, uh, some pretty nice, uh, pieces of, uh, well, wood, for, for different things for tables, for, for, uh, chairs, for, you know, decks and so forth	###.###.###but not so here in texas.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###no,###they don't have basements.###well, i'm from up north also### and, and, uh, no###there's no t-, basements down here###and it --n403892's kind of, uh, hard to get, uh, shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that.###.###yeah.###.###yeah,###lot of the equipment --n403a40, too, that i've, i've used --n403a7b in the past, uh, i w-, you know, i've used --n403abe in school###and, uh, i would,###i don't know,

138340:30	i mean i'm sure there's some good ones,	###how come you wouldn't take them to a day-care --n4003d4.###.###uh,###.###just because of the,###.###well, too many kids and, and i think --n4004c6 too many infections and things coming in.###.###yeah,###they seem --n4005c3 to pass a lot of,###.###yeah,###sicknesses and,###i don't know,###then all the things you hear --n4006e5 about them.###.###yeah,###you kind of wonder whether or not,###.###yeah,
138349:36	but i kind of, i liked it some ways	###they seem --n4005c3 to pass a lot of,###.###yeah,###sicknesses and,###i don't know,###then all the things you hear --n4006e5 about them.###.###yeah,###you kind of wonder whether or not,###.###yeah,###i mean i'm sure there's some good ones,###but i just,###i don't think that i would, uh,###.###i took, uh, cammy to a,###oh, it was a preschool day-care type of thing.###.###oh, uh-huh.###.
138350:6	and some ways i didn't.	###.###yeah,###sicknesses and,###i don't know,###then all the things you hear --n4006e5 about them.###.###yeah,###you kind of wonder whether or not,###.###yeah,###i mean i'm sure there's some good ones,###but i just,###i don't think that i would, uh,###.###i took, uh, cammy to a,###oh, it was a preschool day-care type of thing.###.###oh, uh-huh.###.###but i kind of, i liked it some ways
138469:69	then, then on the other hand i think it --n4033ea's harder to stay home in some regards.	###the older ones it's not,###you don't even really have any real worries, because you know that they'll play with whoever --n402bcf's there###and they usually adapt pretty well.###.###yeah.###.###but, uh,###.###yeah,### it, it --n402d77 is, i think --n402d92, just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will --n402df1.###.###well, and you know their, kind of their schedules###and you know if they're upset and that type of a deal.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###i don't know how, uh, people, uh, that --n40311d have young kids working work full time and, and do it, really, without --n403170 being stressed out all the time --n40318f.###i think it's,###well, i don't know,
138544:21	you have --n400c7c to have some form of health insurance.	###i think,###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###i think that's what the subject is about --n4003c1.###.###did you read, uh, the article in the paper today about this particular subject.###.###in the dallas, the morning times.###.###yeah.###.###i guess i did not.###.###uh, the state of washington and the state of minnesota is, uh, going --n400635 to begin --n400644 testing a program, a state funded program for citizens of those two states###and there's fourteen other, uh, states that --n4007e6 are considering it. least according to the article in the paper this morning.###i think it's a trend that --n40091f's, that --n400932's, that --n400949's, uh, probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need --n4009a8.###it's getting to a point that you have --n400bb7 to have it --n400bca,
138703:48	same sort of problem that --n4008ad happens sometimes is these, some of these, uh, like aids tests and such.	###uh, what do you think --n40007f about it.###.###uh, i think it's a real good concept.###uh, drug testing procedures would have --n40019e to be refined --n4001b1.###.###uh-huh.###.###from what i've seen --n400259 on the news, there's a, a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy, poor procedure in, uh, drug testing.###.###oh, i didn't realize that.###.###yeah.###uh, there have been people who --n400477 have been turned down --n40048e for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their, in their, uh, test,###but they didn't know for sure what it was --n400657,###but it was a drug,###so they got turned --n40072c down###and, uh, turns out it was a prescription. or people getting somebody else's blood test.###.###uh-huh.###.
138712:73	uh, i don't remember what they call it --n400ad6, sort of like a positive, negatives or some, some kind of word they use --n400b31 when a, uh, you get a, uh, a positive indication of drugs --n400b90, but there's not really, there weren't really any there --n400bcb.	###oh, i didn't realize that.###.###yeah.###uh, there have been people who --n400477 have been turned down --n40048e for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their, in their, uh, test,###but they didn't know for sure what it was --n400657,###but it was a drug,###so they got turned --n40072c down###and, uh, turns out it was a prescription. or people getting somebody else's blood test.###.###uh-huh.###.###same sort of problem that --n4008ad happens sometimes is these, some of these, uh, like aids tests and such.###.###okay.###.###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###that's right,###i have heard,
138873:64	seems to me i remember that, uh, i was hired --n403e4f, came in and went through some orientation	###.###right,###uh, everyone coming in gets, goes through the drug test.###.###yeah.###uh, now, uh, were you asked --n403a1e to wait before --n403a31 starting --n403a3c to work until the drug test came through###or,###.###uh, no,###well, let me think about that.###yeah,###it was after, i w-, i had already been hired --n403c52.###uh,###.###okay.###.###yeah,###you get hired --n403d59,###then you come in the first,###i,
138929:40	so here, i know that, uh, last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state	###well, considering you moved here from california, i guess, the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have --n4000b6 down there.###.###yeah,###we have, uh, in california,### i'm in c-, i lived in central california.###we have rain couple times a year###and other than that, you know, it would be maybe october and then in the spring###and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain.###so,###.###especially the last few years.###.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.### it's kind of, it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it, uh,###.###yeah,###there has.
138943:28	you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting --n400b2c in december,	###yeah.###.### it's kind of, it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it, uh,###.###yeah,###there has.###so here, i know that, uh, last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state###and i'm glad --n40080f to see there haven't been any this year.###.###yet.###.###yeah,###yet.### still could come,###huh.###.###generally if we're going --n400995 to get them, it's not going --n4009bc to happen, uh, prior to january one.###.###uh-huh.###.
139232:59	uh, you know, i, i didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that.	###jerry, what did you think --n4014c7 of people like, uh, jane fonda, another war an-, anti-war activist.###.###i,### don't get me started --n40161c on those people.###you know, before she, before jane fonda did, did what she did --n4016de, i thought she was a wonderful person,###but after, uh, uh, well,### i, i just don't have anything, want anything to do --n4018ee with her any more,###because you support, uh, you support your government.###.###right or wrong.###.###uh, okay,###right or wrong,###i don't think is, is, we can determine whether we were right or wrong,###because, you're, you're having --n401c95 to deal with, again, uh,###i think we could have made a different agreement --n401d9c back in for-, the for-, the late forties era that --n401ddf would have kept mumblex of there.###.###uh-huh.###.###.
139654:36	my folks and i always had a dog and a cat, some, birds,	###and they love it.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, because my daughter calls it her gravy###and i mean, she thinks it's wonderful,###.###.###my, good, you're a picky eater, if i can get you to,###.###.###okay, um,###do you have any pets now.###.###well, we don't right now,###no.###we've, uh,###i grew up with, uh, with pets.###.###.

140815:71	you know, maybe you nee-, you can get it signed --n403671 up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes.	### what, what's the deal --n402e32,### we, we try --n402eb4 to, we're trying --n402ed3 to take it on walks now, you know###.###uh-huh.###.###and we can't because it's not accustomed to --n403056 being on a leash###.###yeah.###.###and so it, i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed --n403153 or something when you try --n40316e to, you know, tug on it --n403195 to walk it --n4031a8.###i mean, it just goes like a mad dog,###i mean it just jumps up and down and starts --n4033ed yapping,###and it's, you know, i mean, it's not even close to even being trained --n4034cd on a leash.###.###does it, oh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.
140818:41	well, we've heard bad, we've heard some bad things about some of those, you know,	###uh-huh.###.###and we can't because it's not accustomed to --n403056 being on a leash###.###yeah.###.###and so it, i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed --n403153 or something when you try --n40316e to, you know, tug on it --n403195 to walk it --n4031a8.###i mean, it just goes like a mad dog,###i mean it just jumps up and down and starts --n4033ed yapping,###and it's, you know, i mean, it's not even close to even being trained --n4034cd on a leash.###.###does it, oh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###you know, maybe you nee-, you can get it signed --n403671 up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes.###.###uh-huh.

140921:16	and i'll take some time and do that with her.	###um, uh, let's see,###we have a computer###and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer.###um, uh, let's what else we do --n4008b7.###oh, plus we watch a little t v together.###we really don't watch, i think --n4009ea, as much t v as a lot of people.###.###uh-huh.###.###we don't have h b o.###we do get the disney channel for the kids.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, my kids have a nintendo which they play --n400c02,###and my husband sometimes joins them with that.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, my little girl, jennifer, likes --n400d2c to do crafty things,
140964:11	and spend some time with him.	###.###yeah.###.### and, and it,###and that's kind of cutting into your, your time.###.###yeah.###.###and with the kids getting older, now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which --n4016ee really is late,###.###uh-huh.###.###but, you know, on school nights, the two older ones get to bed about nine.###they go upstairs at nine,###and, um, now, this weekend we'll have a baby-sitter come###and, uh, my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and, um, probably not too late.###.###uh-huh.###.###maybe brian will still be up,
141004:32	and then they'll get --n402860 to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get --n402893 to pick --n4028a2 out	###.###but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i want it kept --n40231c --n402323, it is hard.###.###yeah.###.###.###i can imagine.###.###um.###.###yeah.###.###even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything --n4024e9.###.###uh-huh.###.###and that's another thing,###i'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping, um, usually on the weekend,###and that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son,###and they'll be my helper,
141187:6	and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat.	###.###do you all just start --n400e1d planning real far ahead of time.###.###pardon.###.###uh, do you all start --n400eed planning real far ahead of time.###.###well, no.###there is kind of a set pattern to it.###there is, uh,###so, uh, the day it happens --n4010a7 is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah.###uh, we, uh, get together, at the, uh, the park, uh, the, uh, the park, and playground area of the church i was raised --n401260 in --n40126b###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, everybody brings lots of food
141287:39	there is one cousin out in colorado, uh, uh, some cousins over in phoenix, uh,	###.###but, uh, you know, we have relatives scattered out all over louisiana, mississippi, uh, here in texas###.###yeah.###.###but it --n402deb is harder for everyone to get in, get home.###.###yeah.###well, maybe this year you can find a more central location.###.###well, but the majority of them are in, like, just like how you said --n402fc0 in close, close quarters.###so it --n4030f9 is easier for us few stragglers to go home.###.###oh, okay.###then the majority of them are still in the missouri area.###.###yeah.###.###okay.###you know our family right now, uh, the most of it, there is only a few stragglers, uh, with any distance.
141886:24	you know, i mean, some topics,	###and it happened --n403f89 to be my friend who --n403fa4 lives a few blocks away.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah,###and it was really.###we were laughing, i mean --n404108.###but, you know, we don't really do any gardening,###so like, that took like a minute###.###uh-huh.###.###and then we just talked about, you know, whatever, i mean.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###interesting.###yeah.###.
141908:36	well, it seems like, i don't know, some things are sensationalized --n404d98	###there really isn't much to say --n40453f after you know, you, uh, you know, you, you tell the person what, uh, news there, uh, you know, where their, where they find their sources of information from --n404606###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###and then, you know, if it's, uh, if they're satisfied,###and that's about it, really.###.###uh-huh.###.###it --n404a2e's hard to talk for five minutes on this.###.###yeah.###.###so, um.###.###yeah.###well, i guess i can just say i, it --n404b8e bothers me that i hear a lot about, um, you know, on the news that,
141909:6	or some things are, um, you know,	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###and then, you know, if it's, uh, if they're satisfied,###and that's about it, really.###.###uh-huh.###.###it --n404a2e's hard to talk for five minutes on this.###.###yeah.###.###so, um.###.###yeah.###well, i guess i can just say i, it --n404b8e bothers me that i hear a lot about, um, you know, on the news that,###well, it seems like, i don't know, some things are sensationalized --n404d98
141921:54	and, uh, i also like --n400202 to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts.	###.###yeah.###.###so, um.###.###yeah.###well, i guess i can just say i, it --n404b8e bothers me that i hear a lot about, um, you know, on the news that,###well, it seems like, i don't know, some things are sensationalized --n404d98###or some things are, um, you know,###you'll hear one report###and then you'll hear that it, you know, they didn't, um.###.###.###okay, uh,###what kind of hobbies do you have --n400062 lori.###.###uh, i guess, i, uh, i like --n400101 to play golf.###.###uh-huh.###.
142083:38	some, uh, you know, i have some good shots and some bad shots.	###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###i took one lesson one other time.###besides that, uh, i just, uh, try --n402e5b to make the club hit the ball.###.###right.###.###.###yeah,###i know what you mean --n402f6c.###.###i don't want --n402fd8 to play strike out, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i have fun --n4030a4 doing it,
142083:50	some, uh, you know, i have some good shots and some bad shots.	###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###i took one lesson one other time.###besides that, uh, i just, uh, try --n402e5b to make the club hit the ball.###.###right.###.###.###yeah,###i know what you mean --n402f6c.###.###i don't want --n402fd8 to play strike out, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i have fun --n4030a4 doing it,
142117:69	and i even had, uh, i guess it was --n403d5f last year or the year before, i had some out	###.###uh-huh.###.###she put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants.###.###right.###.###and they have been,###we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had --n40393a they have been blooming just fine.###.###oh, they do great.###i put mine in probably in november.###.###that is when she did --n403af9, i think --n403b10.###.###yeah,###i think it was november###and i don't do anything to mine, water them or anything.###and they just,###they do really good
142141:14	i have got some of those too,	###i didn't do anything to them###so they are, uh, they are good to plant in the winter time.###they last for a long time then.###so, if you start --n4040ff putting them, you know, you can put them out in the spring too,###but once it starts --n404222 getting real hot then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time.###will they make it through the summer sun.###.###no,###they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot,###but they make it through probably winter and spring.###so,###.###well.###.###yeah,
142147:41	and i do, i try --n404720 to do some arts and crafts	###uh-huh.###.###.###do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time.###will they make it through the summer sun.###.###no,###they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot,###but they make it through probably winter and spring.###so,###.###well.###.###yeah,###i have got some of those too,###cause i love flowers.###.###well, that is good.###.###yeah.
142160:49	i, uh like you, i haven't done any in quite some time except for what i call --n400131 living now which --n400144 is, which --n400157 is very close to camping.	###yeah,###i have got some of those too,###cause i love flowers.###.###well, that is good.###.###yeah.###and i do, i try --n404720 to do some arts and crafts###and i love --n4047db to go,###.###.###yeah.###.###okay,###so you enjoy camping.###.###oh, yeah.###.###yeah.###.
142275:198	but, uh, you know, right now, uh, what we did --n401e70, my wife and i, is we got a mobile home. one of these twelve by forty-eight's that --n401ecf got repoed --n401ede, and, uh, swapped them a cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring i would build a house some day, you know.	###uh-huh.###.###they didn't have phone lines.###you just couldn't get phones.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, we are on the, we are third from the end on the electric string.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, we are at the end of the mail route.###.###yeah.###.###like i said, we are probably as far as you can get from the seven eleven and still be in texas.###.###yeah,###i guess so, huh.###.
142499:11	there are some columns that --n40196f could be painted --n401982 --n401989 a different color too.	###.###so, i am thinking i am going --n40141d to change it to, uh, something, you know,###the brick is multi color. mostly earth tones.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think i am going --n4015bc to put something like a brown on it, on the outside. and maybe, a little deeper brown --n401613 in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little.###.###oh, that will be nice.###.###.###huh.###.###what color did you paint --n401852,###.### or, two tone, or two tone. you know.###.###yeah.###.###.
142780:82	as far as the rangers are concerned --n40217e, i think, i think they need some, definitely need some pitching.	###.###i'm awful sorry he's not still.###.###oh, yeah,###but you know, what, he,###that was a great deal for him.###.###oh, i'm sure it was.###.###yeah,###it was a great deal for him### and, and, uh, he just signed on, uh,###i think it was like a five year deal with, uh pittsburgh.###.###pittsburgh.###.###.###yeah.###.###so, you know, he's real happy there.
142828:81	and i think you're probably right, that they, that they need some, you know, some changes in, uh, pitching coach, maybe	###no,###no,###i really don't.###.###.###and i'm not going --n402b6a to stand up, you know on my, soapbox and say that,###.###.###but i'm, not fond of howse###.###.###and i'm not fond of grieves.###.###oh, tom grieve.###.###yeah.###.###yeah.### i'm, i'm not sure that, um, that they're ready --n402dde to get rid --n402df1 of, of, uh, tom grieve yet,###but howse might be a different, uh, situation,
142849:33	they need --n4038ee to have some, some young guys that --n403915 can take the lead	###and, um,###.###well, i'm just gullible enough that i think bobby valentine is, um, uh, doing all right###and i'm sure,###.###you do, huh.###.###well,###.###that's contrary to, uh, popular belief, you know.###.###oh, i know,###i know so,###but i would like so much for these rangers to get their act together and give, um, oh, uh, nolan ryan the support he needs --n403526.###.###oh, i know.###you know, it --n403684's too bad that, uh, it has --n4036af to be a forty-two year old guy --n4036d6 to, to lead the, uh, the rangers, you know.###.###i understand.###.
142965:19	actually now you can get some really good deals --n401859 flying over,	###so, i went to england,###and i really liked it there too.###.###it's so expensive over there.###.###i know,###it's true.###.###.###that's the one thing.###.###it really is.### it just, it's, it's,###i love --n4016f3 to go over there,###but it --n40176a's so darn expensive to go over.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,
142993:39	you know, i'd like --n401d29 to go to hawaii some time,	###just.###.###.###right.###then you can stay with them,###and yeah.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###that helps a lot.###.###yeah.###.###but.###.###you know there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone --n401c29.###.###uh-huh.###.
143054:37	well, you'll just have --n402a23 to plan a vacation some time and, and go over there.	###.###it's, uh,###both coasts are really pretty###.###yeah.###.###but, um, i love the carolinas.###it's just gorgeous over there.###.###uh-huh.###i haven't been there, anywhere on the east coast.###.###yeah.###.###i think tennessee has been the furthest east i've been --n40292d.###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah.###.
143183:27	it sounds like we've been to some of the same places.	###yeah,###my cousin came over while i was there,###and she came to cameroon###and then she went over to nairobi and took a safari around you know, close to nairobi in kenya.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh how neat.###.###so, she'd always dreamed of --n404703 doing that too.###.###yeah,###that's great.###.###so. yeah.###so is there any place you would try --n40482c to talk me into --n404843 going to --n404852.###.###uh.###.
143543:20	and there are, uh, some fairly sophisticated approaches that --n401196 are used --n4011a5 in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people, uh, gain a competence with respect to the material.	###i had never intended --n40051a to do it###and i was, uh, uh, given --n4005ab the opportunity --n4005ba after i'd started a management consulting firm to teach in, in, uh, uh, one of the business schools in the california state university system.###.###uh-huh.###.###at any rate, uh, the topic is fascinating because one of the things i've done --n400802 for the past few years is, uh, research the problem from the point of view of, uh, uh, what --n400869 appears --n400874 to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically --n4008a7.###.###uh-huh.###.###you may be familiar with cooperative learning.###have you ever,###.###well you can, you can tell me a little bit more about it because i don't think we did that in utah.###.###well, the cooperative learning is a technique that --n400d13 was tried --n400d22 initially to integrate the public schools.###and, uh, what, what it involves --n400e24, basically, is the use of peer groups###and the, uh, teacher becomes a, uh, a sort of a consultant, resource person to the cooperative learning, uh, to the learning cooperatives, i guess they're called --n400fb5 --n400fbc.###.###uh-huh.###.
143578:37	you must see kids with real significant problems, uh, in some cases.	###uh-huh.###.###and, my feeling is that, uh, those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually.###i don't know what form it will ultimately take --n402100.###uh, uh, but, i think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for, uh, inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior --n402215,###so it must be the way we're managing the process --n40239a that, uh,###.###yeah,###i see what year saying --n402482,###yeah,###i totally agree.###.### i, i don't, i don't think it's, it's a matter of, of, uh, talented people --n4025d4 to do it, a-, both as, quote, unquote students and as teachers,###but clearly what --n402835's happened in this country is the school system's been asked --n402870 to assume a great many responsibilities --n40288f in the past thirty years that --n4028ae weren't existent, uh,###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
143722:15	but i know some people can get, get, you know, carried --n4017c0 away with them and let them get out of hand.	###so that way we keep out of debt###.###and we keep on top of what we're spending --n4013ea.###.###well, the interest rates in credit cards is so high --n40149f now compared to what your savings is bringing --n4014c6.###.###yeah.###.###speakerb38-1*t38-1.###it --n4015af's really, i guess --n4015ce ridiculous to let them keep --n4015ed building.###speakeranan*t38-1.###speakera38-2*t38-2.###yeah,###yeah,###that's what i feel --n40170a.###speakerbnan*t38-2.###.###so,###.###speakerb42-1*t42-1.
143752:15	it seems that some of them have gotten higher	###.###and so, you know, s-, a bill will come in###.###and i'll think, oh, no i didn't know it was going --n401d34 to be that high.###uh-huh.###.###speakerb47-1*t47-1.###uh-, yeah.###speakeranan*t47-1.###speakera47-2*t47-2.###but so far, i've been able to, we've been able --n401e99 to pay it off every time###speakerbnan*t47-2.###speakerb47-3*t47-3.###so,###speakeranan*t47-3.###.###well, that's good.###.###speakerb49-1*t49-1.### i'm looking, right now i'm k-, kind of looking for a visa that --n40205b has a lower interest rate.
143761:49	i don't know if it was tennessee or arkansas or some, some other state --n4023c8 had a visa card that --n4023e3 was the lowest one in the country.	###speakera47-2*t47-2.###but so far, i've been able to, we've been able --n401e99 to pay it off every time###speakerbnan*t47-2.###speakerb47-3*t47-3.###so,###speakeranan*t47-3.###.###well, that's good.###.###speakerb49-1*t49-1.### i'm looking, right now i'm k-, kind of looking for a visa that --n40205b has a lower interest rate.###it seems that some of them have gotten higher###speakeranan*t49-1.###speakera49-2*t49-2.###uh-huh.###speakerbnan*t49-2.###.###and, uh, i saw on t v, they had a program on, uh, credit cards###.###and they're supposed --n40232c to,
143878:14	i've got some that i, you know, i haven't even used --n403d31 at all, uh, past few years	###yeah.###.###i just figure with the visa and american express, i probably have an,###.###uh-huh.###i can do enough damage with those two.###.###yeah,###.###speakera93-1*t93-1.###i think it --n403b8f's best to keep the number --n403bb2 down that you have --n403bc9.###speakerbnan*t93-1.###speakerb93-2*t93-2.###uh-huh.###speakeranan*t93-2.###.###yeah.###.###so,###.
144063:31	well, th-, there were some people that, uh, that --n402b24 had a problem with that. because they found out later on that, jeez, you know, a guy will lie rather than get killed --n402b97.	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###see, the only thing i don't, you know, i don't understand --n402225, i guess i, i don't understand our judicial system, uh, as it is right now###because i, you know, if somebody has been convicted --n40243b and has been sentenced --n402452 --n402459 to be put --n40246c to death, how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of ex-, execution --n4024c7.###i mean, how, you know,###is there,###.###well,###.###.### th-, that goes back to when, uh, america was a, a colony of england --n4027b7.###.###uh-huh.###.###in england, you went to court,###you were assumed --n40293d guilty until proven innocent###and once they found you guilty, you know, judge said, he's guilty,### kill him.
144511:39	but, uh, uh, i know that, uh, in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent, you know, so that, uh, the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything.	###.###and, uh, i mean, it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh,###.###i think for a lot of people it has.###.###certainly.###.###so,###.###yeah.###.###so,###.
144671:85	a lot of the, my family, you know, they fear me working like that and, under some, some of those conditions,	###.###so,###.###it seems --n404f01 to take more than, uh, for any little thing they do --n404f40,###it seems --n40500a to take a lot more money that you would think it would. you know.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###but, uh,###.###did you have any fear --n4051b4 working in the hospital with that,###.###that's one thing i've never really feared --n40526e.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, uh, i,
145009:13	and you hear some people say, you know, well, he's a man,	###and it shouldn't, uh, it shouldn't be that way. you know.###.###no.###.###.### that, that i think --n401d03 should change, will change in the near future also.###.###i think so, hope so,###a-,###.###it's been changing,###it's been evolving,###but there's still a, an, an inequality in the work forces or jobs.###.###absolutely.###.###it's, you know,###.###you know, i've,###.
145352:42	i, i know pe-, i know some other people that --n400242 have done that.	###yes.###.###.###and it --n4041b6's amazing how much good things like, uh, sesame street will do --n4041f5.###.### it's, it's phenomenal.###.###mumblex.###.###it's phenomenal, the programming, the human operating system,###.###.###well, credit cards.###.###yeah.###.###i'll tell you what,### i, i can't say a whole lot about credit cards because i, uh, tore mine up.###.###is that right.
145355:18	uh, i got in some problems with, uh, financial problems because of credit cards	###and it --n4041b6's amazing how much good things like, uh, sesame street will do --n4041f5.###.### it's, it's phenomenal.###.###mumblex.###.###it's phenomenal, the programming, the human operating system,###.###.###well, credit cards.###.###yeah.###.###i'll tell you what,### i, i can't say a whole lot about credit cards because i, uh, tore mine up.###.###is that right.### i, i know pe-, i know some other people that --n400242 have done that.###.###yeah,
145369:58	i h-, i have, we have some, some friends that --n40087a did the, exactly the same thing.	### i, i can't say a whole lot about credit cards because i, uh, tore mine up.###.###is that right.### i, i know pe-, i know some other people that --n400242 have done that.###.###yeah,###uh, i got in some problems with, uh, financial problems because of credit cards###so i, uh, basically just got rid --n400464 of all of them.###.###um.###.### i, i have a, a couple.###i have a, uh, gas card that i, that i use --n400609 just for gas and you know, uh, one that i use --n400644 just for emergencies###.###uh-huh.###.###but,###.###uh-huh,###yeah,
145433:59	even with my gas card you know, i find that i'll go in --n401f2d to get some gas	###.###i wish i did,### but but i don't.###.###yeah.###.###uh, and it, you know, it,###i just don't want --n401b96 to get into that situation again,###so we'll,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###i mean, it, it's easy,###i mean, you don't have anything --n401d56 transferring, just a little signature,###so what, you know.###.###oh, that's it.###see, and that's,
145454:30	i mean, there are sort some inherent limits there,	###.###uh-huh.###.###and i'll end up --n402032 buying, you know, candy and drinks and you know, sweets and whatever,###.###right.###.###and then at the end of the month i, you know, i get a bill###and i'm thinking what --n40224d did i get --n402260, that --n40226f costs so much.###.###surprising.###.###.###yeah.###.###and,###.###well, you know, but the,###.###.
145536:63	i, in fact, i've, i've even, uh, heard some people that --n403cb5 have applied for credit cards with much less, uh rates and have paid off their, you know higher interest rate, uh cards and just sent them back, you know.	###.###but she's paying it,###and, uh, i just won't do it.###i mean, she's paying, i don't know, i don't know what per month, you know, forty, fifty dollars per month in interest###.###oh, jeez.###.###and i just, you know, i just refuse --n40395a to give it to them.###.###.###if i need --n403a4b to borrow that kind of money, i'll go to the bank###and, uh,###.###yeah,###and then, you bet.###.###you know.###.###that's,###uh, yeah,
145552:67	and i, i guess there's some, there's, uh, uh, some negotiating there, too,	###you know.###.###that's,###uh, yeah,### i, in fact, i've, i've even, uh, heard some people that --n403cb5 have applied for credit cards with much less, uh rates and have paid off their, you know higher interest rate, uh cards and just sent them back, you know.###.###income.###.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###.###yeah.###.
145692:12	and they took some rooms down at a holiday inn	###mumblex.###.###.###yeah,###well, my experience, uh, has been limited --n401d26 pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side###and, uh, they haven't had a reunion since then.###they just show up at funerals and weddings.###.###oh.###.###it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that,###.###wow.###.###but, anyway, my mother's side we had our, our first real reunion that i've ever gone to --n4020e8 last summer###and they had people come in from out of town
145693:19	and, uh, they had some activity,	###.###.###yeah,###well, my experience, uh, has been limited --n401d26 pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side###and, uh, they haven't had a reunion since then.###they just show up at funerals and weddings.###.###oh.###.###it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that,###.###wow.###.###but, anyway, my mother's side we had our, our first real reunion that i've ever gone to --n4020e8 last summer###and they had people come in from out of town###and they took some rooms down at a holiday inn
145721:34	uh, i found out some, about some of the relatives	###and, uh, inevitably everyone is just very interested### and, and they always have, you know, two or three new ones --n402a8f to add --n402a9e to the list, you know,###someone's been born --n402bd6###or someone passed away###or, you know, something like that###.###oh.###.###and so everyone has --n402ce8 to update their little books or whatever.###.###well, have have you, do you have an interest in genealogy.###.###.###uh, i do, but not to, very much compared to my mother-in-law.###.###not a passion, huh.###.###.###uh, i suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy###and i, i suspect we will do more of it.
145722:71	i didn't, you know, i, i didn't even know their names, some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles	### and, and they always have, you know, two or three new ones --n402a8f to add --n402a9e to the list, you know,###someone's been born --n402bd6###or someone passed away###or, you know, something like that###.###oh.###.###and so everyone has --n402ce8 to update their little books or whatever.###.###well, have have you, do you have an interest in genealogy.###.###.###uh, i do, but not to, very much compared to my mother-in-law.###.###not a passion, huh.###.###.###uh, i suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy###and i, i suspect we will do more of it.###uh, i found out some, about some of the relatives
145722:97	i didn't, you know, i, i didn't even know their names, some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles	### and, and they always have, you know, two or three new ones --n402a8f to add --n402a9e to the list, you know,###someone's been born --n402bd6###or someone passed away###or, you know, something like that###.###oh.###.###and so everyone has --n402ce8 to update their little books or whatever.###.###well, have have you, do you have an interest in genealogy.###.###.###uh, i do, but not to, very much compared to my mother-in-law.###.###not a passion, huh.###.###.###uh, i suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy###and i, i suspect we will do more of it.###uh, i found out some, about some of the relatives
145917:27	because i looked into --n40243b picking up some, uh, medical insurance for my, just for my family, you know, just,	###.###and i would,###i really,###and the way medical expenses are --n401ffc i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to ha-, you need --n40204b to have --n40205a.###.###it's,###.###.###yeah.###.###.### it, it,###.###.###yeah,###i'll tell you what,###that is the single most uh, benefit that i, that i enjoyed --n402305, and i do miss --n402320###.###right.###.
145945:125	i guess what, the other benefits that, uh, that i, uh, that i miss --n402d25, i guess is, uh, you know, some of the bonuses and stuff that that --n402d74 goes on with just being involved --n402d97 with a big company, you know	###.###and, uh, yeah,###.###even at a group rate, i couldn't believe how much is our,###.###oh, yeah###.###.###even at a group rate.###uh, it's, it's unbelievable###and, uh, the amount that you have --n402980 to pay --n40298f for, you know, for kids### and, and if you want --n402ab7 to add dental to it, i mean, that's that eats even more.###.###right,###it goes up.###.###.###right.###.###so, yeah,
146091:18	um, i've done some cross stitching.	###oh.###.###but i married a texan,###and they have a way of --n4007bb dragging you back home.###.###.###anyway, we're supposed --n400856 to be talking about crafts.### do you, um, do you have any hobbies that, that you do things --n400933 with your hands like knitting or --n400952,###.###um.###.###.###well, i crochet,###and i do water color,###and i, um, sew###and i do fabric painting.###.###oh, you do a lot then.###do you do needlepoint --n400c27 also and cross stitching.###.
146198:134	well, one thing that i like --n402c70 about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a t shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then, um, cut out a little pattern --n402cf3 from the material, from some material, like flowers or something, and make, um, a design or, you know, a little arrangement or something on the shirt and, you know, fuse it on with heat and bond, or whatever and then paint around it.	###but, uh, you know, to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that, it's a tremendous amount of work.###.###well, i haven't done tons of them.###but, um, i used --n40265f to do more before, um, before i had, before we got our baby,###but.###.###oh, you think, children,###you can, um, use crafts --n402857 to make wonderful things for children.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think when babies,###i think afghans and, and the crocheted little sweaters, and, are, are wonderful.### and, and they'll wear them.###.###yes,###exactly.###.###once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them.###.
146225:40	so i had, i went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back	###oh, yes,###i think it's very clever.###it --n403369's, uh, funny that you said.###for christmas, my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made --n403441 for us.###a beautiful christmas design,###.###oh.###.###and they were matching###and they were lovely,###but when i washed them --n4035d7, although i took the precaution of --n4035fa turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else. and truly, everything --n403641 fell off, or most of it.###.###oh, sure.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh, really.###.
146544:24	i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for --n401193 --n40119a, you know, if you are faced --n4011c1 with placing someone. in a place like that, uh, you know, aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that --n40122c is offered --n40123b and such	###uh-huh.###.###that way.###.###yes,###i would find it --n400bfd very difficult, uh, to, uh, place eit-, my father or my step-mother uh, in a place like that. particularly, since i know how they feel about it --n400c94.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right,### it's basically, it's more how they feel about it --n400e89.###.###yes.###.###and it is like they feel, they are, uh, the way my mother would put it --n400fb3 like somebody had thrown them away. you know.###.###yes.###.###.
146576:17	some, some of the, uh, the people that --n401e74 are in there are real, you know, very nice and friendly to everybody	###and, uh, i know that the cheerful pleasant people who --n40171b treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels --n40175a about, uh, her situation.###.###uh-huh.###and another thing to think about --n4018da, uh, on the positive side of the nursing homes here,###i use --n4019db to work in one of the offices in a nursing home###.###uh-huh.###.###and i got --n401ac4 to see a lot of the things that they did --n401af3###.###uh-huh.###.### they, uh, they had a lot of crafts###.###yes.###.###and they had a lot of games###and, uh, they, get together and just do,### they they do all sorts of things###and then there
146594:81	i think it would matter too, uh, kinds of, uh, disabilities that the nursing home accepts --n402420. because there are some, uh, who --n40244b poor things, you know, don't have, uh, any real grasp on reality any longer.	### they they do all sorts of things###and then there### some, some of the, uh, the people that --n401e74 are in there are real, you know, very nice and friendly to everybody###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, then there are others that --n40203f are,###uh, it is just a job###and they just you know want --n402131 to go in and do what they have --n402158 to do --n402167 and get out go home.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, the, the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important.###.###uh-huh.###.###.
146612:75	well, it is like, wel-, the one that i worked in --n4029eb, uh, you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day,	###.###.###i think it would matter too, uh, kinds of, uh, disabilities that the nursing home accepts --n402420. because there are some, uh, who --n40244b poor things, you know, don't have, uh, any real grasp on reality any longer.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###and they may be ambulatory,###but they tend --n4026ec to behave like children, small children###.###yeah.###.###and that would be very difficult i think --n4027d1 for an adult who --n4027ec wasn't in that situation to to have --n402813 to deal with --n402826 on a daily basis.###.###yeah.###.###uh.###.
146618:32	and then you would see see some of the others that --n402cce are were like distant from the other group	###.###right.###.###and they may be ambulatory,###but they tend --n4026ec to behave like children, small children###.###yeah.###.###and that would be very difficult i think --n4027d1 for an adult who --n4027ec wasn't in that situation to to have --n402813 to deal with --n402826 on a daily basis.###.###yeah.###.###uh.###.###well, it is like, wel-, the one that i worked in --n4029eb, uh, you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day,###they would just roll themselves around all over the place### and and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities###.###yes.###.
146619:59	and they they just didn't like participate together with the others because they had some some, uh, i guess, uh, slight mental disabilities and things like that.	###right.###.###and they may be ambulatory,###but they tend --n4026ec to behave like children, small children###.###yeah.###.###and that would be very difficult i think --n4027d1 for an adult who --n4027ec wasn't in that situation to to have --n402813 to deal with --n402826 on a daily basis.###.###yeah.###.###uh.###.###well, it is like, wel-, the one that i worked in --n4029eb, uh, you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day,###they would just roll themselves around all over the place### and and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities###.###yes.###.###and then you would see see some of the others that --n402cce are were like distant from the other group
146662:13	and there are some fire stations i can take newspapers to --n40098b	###well, i definitely think that we need --n4000d7 to start --n4000e6 recycling.###i think it has got --n40019d to be an individual responsibility until,###i think if we wait --n400260, uh, which --n400277 is happening until somebody says we have --n40029e to do it it is going --n4002bd to be to late.###.###yeah.###.###i have heard reports --n40045b around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand.###.###yeah,###i have heard that too.###.###and that is not too far away,###but i don't know how it is --n400623 there.###it --n40069f is very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much.###i take, my paper,###i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store###.###uh-huh.###.###and i can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them
146710:44	and i think it is going --n401a0f to come to that because some people will just not go to the,	###i think that is a good idea.###.###and i think that is what it is going --n40153e to have --n40154d to come to --n401560. where we are just forced --n40157f to --n40158a.###.###besides, well like a law or whatever.###an-, that's how it is --n401744 in new york isn't it.###.###yeah.###.###.###i think so,###just because they have --n401865 to. you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###and you get ticketed --n401923 if you don't do it right.###.###right,###uh-huh.
146766:22	well, on-, some of them are five,	###.###yeah,###that's true.###.###it makes it --n402767 worthwhile to take it back###and i've just started --n402812 drinking a new water called clearly canadian,###i don't know if you've tried it###.###yeah,###i have seen them.###.###and they have on the ba-, it's five cents, that they pay five cents###.###uh-huh.###.###and it even shows the states that,###.###that --n402b1a take them back.###.###yeah.
146767:4	some are ten cents.	###yeah,###that's true.###.###it makes it --n402767 worthwhile to take it back###and i've just started --n402812 drinking a new water called clearly canadian,###i don't know if you've tried it###.###yeah,###i have seen them.###.###and they have on the ba-, it's five cents, that they pay five cents###.###uh-huh.###.###and it even shows the states that,###.###that --n402b1a take them back.###.###yeah.###well, on-, some of them are five,
146829:11	you see some of the stuff	###.###.###something else i think we do can do --n403861 is support companies that --n40387c encourage###like, i have decided###downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton --n4039fe###.###yeah.###.###you add wa-,###well, i image everybody else will start --n403af6 doing that sooner or later,###but i am going --n403bc1 to stick with downey because they were first.###.###yeah.###.###and i want them to have my business.###and i think packaging could be done --n403d2b much better.###there is so much plastic.###but,###.###well i know,
146882:10	you buy some	###.###yeah,###i know.###i guess you run into the pollution factor.###.###yeah.###and then just like the glass bottles, that it says on the bottle i can get ten cents, but not in texas --n404da9.###.###yeah.###.###and there is no place i can take glass to --n404edb.###.###uh,###.###so, i still throw away a lot of glass.###.###it is really sad.###.###yeah.###and then the packaging thing really grips me.

147067:15	i know that some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,	###.###yeah,###uh-huh.###.###.###more practical.###.###not,###yes,###it doesn't matter if i have --n1339c to wash it a hundred times or something.###.###when you were teaching --n13476, did you ever have, uh, uh, a blue jean day or anything like that.###.###yeah,###but i never wore jeans because, um, i thought that was too casual.###.###yeah, well,###.###for,###.
147083:36	um, oh, it, there's some good things about it	###yeah, well,###.###for,###.###i know that some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,###and i always thought it was kind of out of, got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too --n1387c.###.###yeah,###really.###.###it's all right for the students,###they look tacky a lot###but i didn't think teachers should, you know.###.###yeah,###that's how i feel --n13b3d too.###.###yeah.###do you like, uh, uh, iowa.###.
147237:51	but i think, uh, we're going --n403fdf to have --n403fee to make some fundamental changes	###yeah,###and i think that, that more and more it --n40333e's becoming apparent to people that the earth, which --n40336d includes all the people on it and everything that --n403398's going on it, is a, is an organism of sorts, and that there is a, a whole set of organic relationships that if we start --n403423 to destroy one part of it, --n403446 it's going --n403459 to tell us about it,###.###right.###.###and, uh, we're going --n403802 to feel it,###and i think it --n403893's going --n4038a2 to be real interesting and particularly in light of what --n4038d1 is obviously going --n4038e4 to be a big structural change in the economy, uh, in this country, uh, whether people are willing --n403943 to get out of their cars,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###and in this country, uh, the, the solution that, that people seem --n403bc6 to think --n403bd9 work are politically unacceptable.###for example, taxing people heavily for --n403d34 using their cars.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, i have a little sports car that i enjoy --n403e14 using --n403e1f###and i know just like anybody else how much fun it --n403ee2 is --n403eed to drive
147291:12	and they needed some quality care,	###.### she, even though she is a hundred and two, she still has all of her faculties.###.###right.###.###she still has her snap.###she takes care of her own business.###this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has --n4007e7 to have a little walker --n400802,###but with somebody that --n4008e0 needs around the clock care,###i have seen my family age.###.###right.###.###i have seen them in the,###she's been there ten years now.###and i have seen them age twenty in the time and, and with the expense and everything,###.###yeah.###.### i th-, i still think it is worth it if you, if you had a good nursing home
147337:25	i am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around dallas.	###oh, that is great.###.###but then i am also facing my father who --n4015b2 is very sick###and my mother and father reside in colorado.###she's been taking care of him.###i don't know how much longer this can last --n40173f###and at that point because he requires round the clock.###he can't do anything without her.###he doesn't know when --n4018be to take his medicine --n4018d5###and it's really sad###and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for, uh,###my brothers are not interested in --n401a78 helping me###so i would have --n401aee to move him down here.###that way,###i want --n401ba9 to see the nursing home. if i have --n401bd4 to put him into one.###you know, where i can go --n401cc0 see it --n401ccf.### i, i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in colorado.###and,###.###oh, why yeah.
147340:7	and some of them are limited care --n401f7a too where people can do, uh,	###and my mother and father reside in colorado.###she's been taking care of him.###i don't know how much longer this can last --n40173f###and at that point because he requires round the clock.###he can't do anything without her.###he doesn't know when --n4018be to take his medicine --n4018d5###and it's really sad###and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for, uh,###my brothers are not interested in --n401a78 helping me###so i would have --n401aee to move him down here.###that way,###i want --n401ba9 to see the nursing home. if i have --n401bd4 to put him into one.###you know, where i can go --n401cc0 see it --n401ccf.### i, i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in colorado.###and,###.###oh, why yeah.###i am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around dallas.###.###yes.
147477:43	so, i, you know, you pick up some traits from her and stuff.	###.###okay.###uh, do you want --n400040 to go ahead###or,###.###oh, sure.###uh, well. i, uh, went to school at madison for two years###and they are really big on women's rights. and, and equal treatment.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and so i, i've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that.###but, uh, i'm not that liberated.###i mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.
147582:28	and it --n4026ba's just too bad that some people, you know, still look down on them just because of their color. you know.	###uh-huh.###.###and my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted --n401fa6###and she's very sharp.###and i think that th-,###and the ethnic thing will be, you know, is a good thing now.###.###oh, me too.###.###they're moving them up###and they're sharp###and they,###so you're going --n4022e6 to see a lot, a lot more of that in leadership i believe --n402329.###.###yeah.###i like --n402443 to see that.###i think it --n4024b5's, uh, really neat to see --n4024e0 and all that educated minority, uh, person who --n40250f really knows what they're talking about --n402532.###.###uh-huh. right.###.
147613:4	some people say oh the boys shouldn't have --n402d6c to do those jobs. the inside jobs.	###.###yeah.###but they wouldn't know what they're doing --n402920.###.###right.###.###but i'm not big on subserving as far as to the men at all.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###but i never have gone along with that, you know. even far back.###but i was brought --n402b87 up pretty good in a home that,###years ago my mother was that way.###the same.###i,###my bo-,###ther-, you know,
147695:26	but i wish they would get some more on that.	###.###oh, i don't know.###.###but you know who i mean --n4041bc.###.###yeah,###i know who you're talking about --n404251.###.###yeah.###she took such a rough go of it.###and they t-, their tax deal and,###.###yeah.###at least she was strong --n4043f2 to like try it and you know.###.###right.###right.###.###so that's good.###.
147754:50	and personally i feel it's probably, there's probably some of each.	### that's an int-, you know, that's interesting.###i had read something one time###and it was just applying to governments in general,###it was written --n4008ec many years ago.###it said that it --n40095b's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who --n40099a choose government for their positions are power seekers.###and i thought that was interesting.###it wasn't just talking about our government.###it was just government in general. from times past, you know on###.###uh-huh.###.###and,###.###so they're saying that government officials would tend --n400cf5 to be power seekers.###.###right.###and that would be a next question to ask --n400ddd.###how many do you think --n400e7b are in there for pub-, for bu-,###because they want --n400f67 to be a service to us###or are they in there for their own gains,
147828:42	and it almost seems like in order --n402b7e to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have --n402bb9 to have the kind of wife that you would only find --n402bec, on, say in the bobsy twins or, something like that.	###.###and it,###.###.###if they tell us the truth, we don't elect them and, especially with all this fron-, co-, stuff --n40255a coming up here lately about people's past,###.###uh-huh.###.###and i don't know why anybody would want --n40272b to get under that scrutiny anymore --n40274a.###.###it's hard to imagine --n402819.###.###because it's, i think it's gotten --n4028ab just care-, well,###.###.###we're not talking about issues###we're talking about somebody's personal life### and, and we're getting away from what we ought --n402a5d to be looking at --n402a74.###.###yeah,
147882:33	the japanese government is always having a, some kind of a scandal.	###but that doesn't eliminate it, does it.###.###i don't think making laws will stop it.###i mean i don't know how many laws you would have --n4037fa to have --n403809.###i mean,###.###well, they've got laws against cannib-, cannibalism###but that didn't stop that guy in, milwaukee, did it.###.###no,### sure didn't, did it.###.###.###so no,###i think you can legislate###but i think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating --n403b8b,###and we would end up with so many more laws that, you know,###i mean i just think that's human nature that you're going --n403d40 to have corruption in government, in business, personal life, i mean, you know.###.###actually, i think other countries may have it worse, uh,
147920:84	oh, well, i guess i like a wide range. uh, everything from, uh, from baroque through at least some modern music.	###i think, uh,###.###yeah.###yeah,###at its worst i think we've got the best.###.###.###well, uh, what is your favorite kind of music --n40003e.###.###well, i have --n4000c2 to say my favorite type of music would probably be, uh, classical music.###.###oh, same here.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah.###.###what type of music do you like --n400272 in the classical area,###or what era do you, era do you like --n400324 the most.###.
148130:31	uh, i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because i do get things from ski associations and things, uh, at, during the year.	###.###we take several at home.### i, i take, um, skiing magazine,###and i take, uh, discover magazine, and also, uh, c d and stereo review and national geographic, i think and boys life.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh, mumblex.###.###.###oh, good.###that's a good one, i like --n10386 to get --n10395.###um, so i take it that you like --n1044e to ski.### do you, do you, um, receive a lot of information on skiing through the ski magazine.###.###i presume that i do.###.###uh-huh.###.
148183:40	i'd like --n11496 to go to sundance and park city and some of those.	###.###oh.###.###we haven't been there before.###.###um, that sounds nice.###.###kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one --n11220.###.###uh-huh.###.###it's supposedly low lift lines.###.###oh.###.###but i haven't skied utah yet,###but i want --n113a0 to.###.###oh, well, you need --n11410 to come out.###.
148200:15	and then we have some church magazines,	###.###oh, well, you need --n11410 to come out.###.###i'd like --n11496 to go to sundance and park city and some of those.###.###uh-huh.###.###i understand deer valley is nice, too.###.###deer valley,###uh-huh.###yeah,###they are,###it's wonderful snow.###.###well, how about you,### what, what magazines do you have --n1173d at home.###.###uh, i am currently taking decorative woodworking, and, uh, country living,###and, let's see, we do have national geographic,

148372:13	and i like some of their songs.	###.###yeah.###.###even some of that i like --n4007a3 okay but not, mostly, as a general rule,###.###yeah.###.###i don't care for that at all.###.###yeah.###i don't enjoy rap too much, either.### that, that doesn't appeal to, uh, my ears.###.###well, as far as the rap goes, i think there are a few artists that --n400a79 appeal to me themselves###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
148456:26	i, i like some of it, um,	###.### it just, it just doesn't do anything.###.###what about the blues or something like that.###.###uh, uh, blues are okay.### i, i tell you,###i do like, um,###i grew up on blue grass music.###my dad is a big blue grass fan,###and so###.###uh-huh.###.###um, i wouldn't have admitted it when i was in high school --n40224f###but, i really do like it a lot.###.###.###so.###.
148463:10	um, some of it sounds more like pop music.	###i do like, um,###i grew up on blue grass music.###my dad is a big blue grass fan,###and so###.###uh-huh.###.###um, i wouldn't have admitted it when i was in high school --n40224f###but, i really do like it a lot.###.###.###so.###.### i, i like some of it, um,###as far as like the cou-, what they now call --n402446 country western, it doesn't sound like the old country music at all, does it.###.###no,###it doesn't,###it doesn't.###.
148529:15	um, i have some spiro gyro tapes.	###.###yeah,###it seems like you get a lot of original music that way.###.###yeah,###you sure do.###.###i mean, you know, think about like the twin peaks and stuff like that that --n403094's just real recent###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###things like that i like --n4031f4 to listen to --n403207.###um, i like instrumental things.###.###uh-huh.###.

148889:35	got that, uh, uh, some insight --n40039b there, --n4003ae to, to kind of help me put together the feelings.	###uh, i don't right off.###.###is that ben franklin then.###.###ben franklin,###okay.###.###.###how do you feel about the viet nam war --n400036.###.###huh, well, um, you know, i guess it's pretty deep feelings, uh,###i just, uh, went back and rented, uh, the movie, what is it --n4001d8, good morning viet nam###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh.###.###yeah,###i saw that as well.###.
149148:54	you know, when you write a test --n402f57 you have --n402f66 to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing --n402fa9 and find out which ones --n402fc4 are discriminating well and which ones --n402fe3 aren't find out how reliable the test is --n403012,	###right.###well, now, we, uh,###what i use a computer for --n402a2a is to write materials that --n402a49 are later printed --n402a5c, though.###.###uh-huh.###.###most of the stuff that i do --n402b80 is not, uh, interactive###.###uh-huh.###.###and i use it for t-, uh, data analysis on testing,###so.###.###uh, to see how well they retain the vocabulary --n402d58 and things like that.###.###well, just, actually, just, uh, item analysis, statistical analysis of the tests,###uh.###.###uh-huh.###.
149162:20	well, i was doing some of the same stuff, but doing it more slowly, and with smaller files.	###.###well, just, actually, just, uh, item analysis, statistical analysis of the tests,###uh.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, when you write a test --n402f57 you have --n402f66 to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing --n402fa9 and find out which ones --n402fc4 are discriminating well and which ones --n402fe3 aren't find out how reliable the test is --n403012,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort.###so it's, involves a lot of spreadsheet use.###.###yeah,###i would imagine so.###um, so, um, what were you doing --n403401 when you were using an apple two e --n403428.###.
149260:67	he's, uh, he has been really aggressive, uh, especially towards my little girl, for some reason.	###uh-huh.###.###oh. uh, how's the disposition of your siamese cat --n4004cc.###.###well, it's, uh, you know###they're just, uh, aggressive by nature###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, he's been neutered and declawed --n400672,###so he's an indoor cat,###.###uh-huh.###.###so, uh, that kind of calms him down for the most part.###.###.###how about yours.###.###well, yeah,
149341:37	and we ended up with, uh, oh, malamute and some other kind of mix.	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###sure.###.###but, uh, he seems --n4018cc to have mellowed out a little bit,###and we do keep our daughter away from him.###so.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house.###.###is that the only pet that you have --n401b0e.###.###it is,###uh-huh.### we, we tried a dog about four years ago,
149373:69	you know, i saw something --n402677 on c n n or on cable here a while ago that --n4026ae showed some people that --n4026c5 had rabbits in apartments and in houses,	###.###we couldn't allow him to run free,###so, he was just chained --n40229c up all the time,###and it was, it was unfortunate.###.###sure.###.###so have you tried any other pets.###.###no,###no.### i, i live alone in an apartment,###and, uh, it's, it's not that big that, uh###.###oh.###.###although i've heard rabbits are pretty good###.###oh.###.
149427:7	and some of the weirdest animals you ever want --n403514 to see --n403523 in there.	###.###huh-uh,### we don't have c, we don't have cable.###.###i see.###well they have, uh, uh, a wesmin-, they call it --n403053 the westminster dog show, uh,###i think it's in new york city at the, at the gardens###there once a year live###.###oh.###.###and they had that on last week,###and that's really kind of something to watch --n403310, uh,###.###oh.###.###it's on, i think --n4033e6, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two###.###is that right.###.
149485:72	and especially in this election year, i think that, uh, there ought --n400160 to be so-, at least some conversation about what we are supposed --n40019b to do --n4001aa about this.	###do you.###.###yeah,###yeah,###yeah.###.###oh, well, see, i'm getting so many calls to texas.###.###this is the very first one i've, i've talked to --n403dc3.###.###oh, well, great.###yeah,###i've been doing it for about two weeks###and, uh, no my, no my,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, uh, i don't know.###i think the budget is really out of hand right now,
149578:42	but with this peace dividend, it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties, or whatever.	###uh-huh.###.###but it seems to me that, uh, that the budget is so out of hand,###and especially now that they say, okay, the cold war is over###and we're supposed --n401bfd to be getting a peace dividend of, you know of x number of billion, trillion dollars a year.###.###uh-huh.###.###well, i'd really like --n401d89 to know where that money is actually going --n401db0 to go --n401dbf,###because, in my opinion, i don't think i'm ever going --n401ecc to see any of this peace, so-called peace dividend.###.###oh, yeah.###yeah,### it's, it's.###.###i mean, if they could actually put something together and make,###i'm not really in favor of large government social programs, either, because i feel that they waste money, also,###.###uh-huh.###.
149669:184	um, what --n4045c6 really bothers me is it just seems like if, if anyone were --n404611 to say, you know, well i'm going --n404640 to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're mumblex, we're going --n404683 to have --n404692 to do some unpopular things, i mean, he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected --n4046e5.	###.###and you just, mumblex.###.### you, you just have --n404079 to wonder what they're thinking --n404098 in washington.###.###i mean, it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun.###.###yeah,###uh, well, it's, it's more than a loaded,###it's a loaded cannon.###i mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend --n4043ab every year,###.###yeah.###.###and they, in my opinion, don't do a very responsible job of spending that money.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, yeah,
149736:22	and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,	###i mean, do you, do you find crime in atlanta really mumblex###i live in atlanta also.###.###well that's right.###uh. uh, i think it is bad in certain areas,###.###uh.###.###however i think, the area that i live in --n40061c it's not, uh, the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the, of the city.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think it seems that there's certain areas where, uh, the crime is focused --n40088c --n400893 uh.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well what do you think --n4009a6 can be done --n4009b9 about the crime in the city.###.###well, i think it's, what --n400ab4's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying --n400b0f to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,
149748:21	you know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends --n401001 to be where a lot of that crime is focused --n401030 --n401037	###i think it seems that there's certain areas where, uh, the crime is focused --n40088c --n400893 uh.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well what do you think --n4009a6 can be done --n4009b9 about the crime in the city.###.###well, i think it's, what --n400ab4's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying --n400b0f to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,###and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,###.###uh-huh.###.###and probably, um, they need --n400ddf to try --n400dee to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, i think --n400e29 mumblex.###.###i probably agree with that.###.###yeah.###.###uh.###.
149891:51	i've actually, i've known, known some people that --n403bfd have had their cars stolen --n403c18.	###yeah.###.###oh, where was, where, where was that --n403835.###was that downtown###or,###.###oh no,###that was in the northern p-, um, up near cumberland mall area.###.###really.###.###it's actually cobb county,###but it is atlanta###.###metropolitan,###yeah.###.###and, uh, there's a lot of car thefts in that area.###.###yeah,
149904:6	and some superficial type damage,	###.###metropolitan,###yeah.###.###and, uh, there's a lot of car thefts in that area.###.###yeah,### i've actually, i've known, known some people that --n403bfd have had their cars stolen --n403c18.###uh, and, uh, and, you know, about half the time they seem --n403d75 to, the a p d seems --n403d98 to recover them, you know in various states of disrepair. up on blocks.###.###right.###.###.###yeah###.###my friend had a v w rabbit,###and when he, when he got it back --n404018 his, um, dashboard was sitting in the front seat.###.###yeah,### mine was just, it had been wrecked --n404164
150006:39	and the, uh, microwave had --n40140d to have, uh, some kind of something i can't even pronounce --n401450,	###uh-huh.###.###and i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such --n400d0b,###and when you get the product --n400dc7 it ends up --n400dda being toxic and all these warnings.###so.###.###um.###.###i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than,###i just ended up --n400fad using it.###but, that's about the only thing i've had --n401044 gone wrong.###but.###.###i usually have pretty good luck with appliances,###but i just, uh,###it --n4011d0 was within two days that all three of these stopped --n4011ff working,###and the the ice maker was, uh, had --n4012db to have a new pump,###.###that's incredible.###.
150735:41	if you wanted --n405075 to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it	###i guess people want --n4048cf to hear about it.###also big in the news right now is --n40497f the braves, because they're, uh, they're in, you know, tr-, spring training or whatever###.###right,###right.###.###and they did so well last year.###.###yeah,### they spent a lot of time, that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,###and i think that, um, that's fine,###i would like --n404da1 to see more time spent --n404dbc on other things.###.###yeah.###.###but.###.###it seems like,###i don't know,###they way they do the newscasts --n404f2a, i wish they, they kind of separated it, you know,
150744:69	i guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who --n40041e is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who --n4004a5 maybe should be convicted --n4004bc.	### they spent a lot of time, that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,###and i think that, um, that's fine,###i would like --n404da1 to see more time spent --n404dbc on other things.###.###yeah.###.###but.###.###it seems like,###i don't know,###they way they do the newscasts --n404f2a, i wish they, they kind of separated it, you know,###if you wanted --n405075 to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it###but i don't have cable.###.###.###i think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of having, uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want --n400082 to make sure that you don't, uh, convict someone who, uh, --n4000cd really shouldn't be convicted --n4000e8.###.###definitely.###.###um, and i think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps --n400313 to ensure that.
150823:92	yeah, i mean, i, i really, i would like --n401af6 to, uh, to do at some point, um,	###yeah.###.###and it, it didn't even hardly go through,###.###oh, didn't really even count.###.###so.###.###yeah.### i'm, i'm a college student###so i haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long###.###yeah.###.###um, and, uh, i did get one summons actually at one point,###but i declined it which i'm able --n401871 to do --n401880 because i'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time.###.###yeah.###well, you learn a lot --n401a02 going to the juries like that though.###.
150826:22	but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.	###.###oh, didn't really even count.###.###so.###.###yeah.### i'm, i'm a college student###so i haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long###.###yeah.###.###um, and, uh, i did get one summons actually at one point,###but i declined it which i'm able --n401871 to do --n401880 because i'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time.###.###yeah.###well, you learn a lot --n401a02 going to the juries like that though.###.###yeah, i mean, i, i really, i would like --n401af6 to, uh, to do at some point, um,###but, i, i haven't.###uh, one, one thing that i, i think --n401d34 is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, i, i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now,
150878:83	in, in the case you were involved in --n403aab, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind.	###yeah,### they, well they picked one person,###and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have --n402d77.###.###so it work-, it did end up --n402e8c working out pretty well.###.###yeah,###it ended up --n402f6c working all right.###.###the one thing i sometimes wonder about --n402ff1, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like pro-, product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision --n4030a4 to be made --n4030b7 sometimes --n4030c2###.###yes.###.###you know, it's not just a matter of, um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy,###and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract,###it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues,###and i wonder if, uh, if there's really, um, if the system works adequately in, in --n40365d educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue --n4036a0 is under discussion.###.### i, i don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really know what --n4038f5's going on.###.
151077:31	but, uh, apparently for some, some crimes, it --n4033cd's permissible to have six people sit in judgment.	###so, uh, the guy had --n402d7e to go through the whole thing all over again.### cost him a lot of money,###i'm sure.###.###yeah.###oh, how many members were --n402f0b on the jury.###was it a six or twelve member jury.###.###uh, it must have been six.###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah.###.###that's kind of curious to me.###i didn't realize until the, uh, wayne kennedy smith trial, uh, a few months ago that they had six member juries.###i thought that they, you know, it was always twelve, twelve men tried and true, so to speak.###.###um.###.
151108:23	it was, yeah, in some of the critical things, like the off-, special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,	###mumblex.###.###is it on, uh, capital crimes that they have --n40389d to be unanimous --n4038b0###and,###.###probably on capital,###i don't know,### we weren't, we, we,###the two that i were on --n403ab2 had --n403abd to do with drugs###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, we were, uh, unanimous is --n403bad acquitting the person, even though we in our, in our, uh, gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends, because of various things,###the government really failed --n403de4 to prove its case,###and, you know, being fair to the person, if the government doesn't prove its case, no matter how you feel --n403ec1, you have --n403ed4 to go by what --n403eeb's offered --n403efa as proof,###and we had --n40408d to acquit him in both cases.###.###uh, it was too circumstantial.###.###uh, yeah,
151138:37	but, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, --n40079f looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,	###so we're talking about drug testing in the work place, huh.###.###drug testing in the work place.###um. i've been tested --n400165 a few times, just before pre-, drug employment.###but that's about it.###i've never had random drug testing.###.###yeah,###we have random drug testing at, in my business,###but i've never been, uh, never had --n4003fa to do it.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah,###yeah,###they started that about a year ago,###and i think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, --n4005cb drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.
151303:29	well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far.	###huh. that's true.###.###you know, i've, i've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case.###.###uh-huh.###do they give any limits on alcohol,###or is it.###.###uh, i don't remember, --n404521 to tell you the truth.###i don't think they do.###um, well, they must,###i mean, gee whiz.###that just shows you how much i've been paying attention --n404708,###because i, i really don't know.###.###.###i'll have --n404830 to go into work tomorrow and ask.###.###oh.###.
151325:29	i mean suppose they found out some other way.	###they did, uh, an unannounced drug sweep of the, of their company###.###uh-huh.###.###oh, it was, it was, it was an unannounced sweep of, of,###it was not only drugs,###.###.###well, uh, i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in, in specific, uh, very specific in this, uh, very specific examples such as, uh, transportation workers, as in, uh, air traffic controllers, bus drivers and that kind of thing.###.###well.###.###um, i don't really think that it's, uh, too many,###i think it --n400413's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, well, we're going --n40045e to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, uh, you know, worthy of --n4004b1 working for us.###i really don't see that that's a very, very valid, uh, thing for a company to say --n4006d7,###and i, personally, i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going --n40081e to reject me on the basis of what --n400845's inside my body.###.###yeah,###uh, i guess i basically agree that, uh,###do you think it --n400a87's okay for a company to reject somebody --n400aae knowing that they'll take drugs.
151338:21	uh, like i said, some industries, though, i think it'd be very necessary,	###i think it --n400413's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, well, we're going --n40045e to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, uh, you know, worthy of --n4004b1 working for us.###i really don't see that that's a very, very valid, uh, thing for a company to say --n4006d7,###and i, personally, i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going --n40081e to reject me on the basis of what --n400845's inside my body.###.###yeah,###uh, i guess i basically agree that, uh,###do you think it --n400a87's okay for a company to reject somebody --n400aae knowing that they'll take drugs.###i mean suppose they found out some other way.###.###well, i think, i think we, i think the problem here is, is that a, a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs.###.###yeah.###.###there's too many cases where it can, you know,###there can be false positive results, and that, that sort of thing.###i don't think there's any definitive, you know, okay this person is taking drugs,###so we don't want him here.###.###yeah.###.
151536:59	and, uh, each one of the, everybody that --n4015e4 showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for like soft drinks	###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's a pretty big reunion,###it's about two hundred people, maybe.###.###oh, my word.###well, what did you find --n401131 was most helpful in planning the birthday get together.###.###um, the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything --n40127d, uh.###.###uh-huh.###.###i guess probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something like that.###.###oh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.
152021:55	and uh, our benefits package isn't, uh, isn't quite as good in some ways. uh, you know,	###uh, i can begin this, um,###basically i work for honeywell in minneapolis###.###uh-huh.###.###and the, the benefit program we have --n4001bb here is really quite good.### i'm, i'm pretty pleased with it.###they cover, uh, just about everything, vision, dental, medical###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, you name it,###and for me this is the first job i've had --n400452 where they've covered that much --n400471,###so i'm pretty satisfied myself.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, what's your situation --n4005cc.###.###i work for the university of new hampshire,
152067:34	unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have --n40164e to finagle your way around --n401669 to get that time.	###and, uh, we get twenty-four days a year, right from the day one when you start work --n400fe3, you get twenty-four days a year, uh, time off.###.###right.###well, that's good.###.###yeah.###.###yeah,###that's one of the things i guess i would change --n40121d about honeywell, is, uh,###i used --n401321 to work with the army research institute,###and being a, uh, a government organization you got quite a few holidays off.###.###right.###.###but here you don't get that.###you maybe get two or three a year.###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's really,
152067:55	unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have --n40164e to finagle your way around --n401669 to get that time.	###and, uh, we get twenty-four days a year, right from the day one when you start work --n400fe3, you get twenty-four days a year, uh, time off.###.###right.###well, that's good.###.###yeah.###.###yeah,###that's one of the things i guess i would change --n40121d about honeywell, is, uh,###i used --n401321 to work with the army research institute,###and being a, uh, a government organization you got quite a few holidays off.###.###right.###.###but here you don't get that.###you maybe get two or three a year.###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's really,
152280:24	i mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.	###uh-huh.###.###and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh.###but i agree, you know, the, uh, medical benefits and those kinds of things --n400fd6 are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, uh, security aspect for long term employment, uh,###.###well, you know that's interesting though.###because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore.###i use --n4012f3 to think that, you know, after you work,###you mean security, job security.###.###job security,###yes.###.###uh, that use --n401487 to be i think a couple of years ago,###but i don't know if it is so much anymore.###in fact, they, we just had a lay off in what november, i guess.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, it wasn't necessarily,
152284:11	like in some of the large oil companies. there has been massive lay offs.	###.###well, you know that's interesting though.###because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore.###i use --n4012f3 to think that, you know, after you work,###you mean security, job security.###.###job security,###yes.###.###uh, that use --n401487 to be i think a couple of years ago,###but i don't know if it is so much anymore.###in fact, they, we just had a lay off in what november, i guess.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, it wasn't necessarily,###i mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.###.###yeah,###we are seeing that here as well.
152359:98	although he, you know, the more complex your structure --n402f25 the, uh, less difficult it --n402f48 is --n402f53 to kind of carry some things through	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###but,###so what else do you think --n402a60 is important.###.###well the, uh,###that's maybe the majority of the importance, i guess --n402b5d.###yeah,###because my perspective is from an institution,###uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###but if you're in the corporate world, i think there is considerable motivation for i guess in-, innovation,
152622:104	uh, my, my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to washington or to the state and they say they are going --n40136b to send some back,	###so###.###well that's nice.###.### from, from taxes###but,###.### nice, nice to get a refund.###.###yeah.###it is,###but it's not much.###so.###.###uh-huh.###do you think that, uh, for whatever taxes we do pay --n4011c3 that, uh, we are getting value for it.###.###no.###.###yeah.
152813:354	also, also i have the observation --n40156a of, uh, with the press is that, like any any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of --n4015ed that i see --n401600 in the press, you know, which --n401627 only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that --n40169e actually had, had more than just a blurb about it. that the press has managed --n4016f5 to just mess up some aspect of the story	###.###yeah.###do you think that t v is, uh, pretty accurate.###i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized###or,###.###well, what i really don't like --n400ec4 about t v, especially local news as compared to like national news is just, uh, it seems, it seems like everything is very spoon feed###and you know it's, it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news, because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports, you know, is your kid's bus driver smoking crack, on the way to school, you know.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###it's###they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.
153020:9	uh, some lady, she, uh,	###.###but i, i've never owned a cat like that.###i've had cats growing up all the time###and you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###huh, that's interesting.###.###so, it's a weird cat.###.###huh. we have a, a mutt.###.###a mutt.###.###well, we, we named it hooper because that's where we got it from --n40103d.###.###uh-huh.###.
153105:51	they're their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens	###.###uh-huh.###.###but, it's a really good dog.###.###yeah.###.###i don't know,###they seem --n40264e to be, i mean, listen better or something.###.###uh-huh.###.###is your cat a purebred.###.###no.###no,###it's just uh an accident.###.###.###from a frie-, uh, from my, my son's friend down the street.
153148:6	and some he destroys --n40387e	###.###uh, the kids couldn't handle him###and i was still going to school###and my wife was working###and i was working###and so we just didn't have time to really train him --n4032c1###so he was kind of jus-, you know, he was too big for the kids to handle --n4033b1,###so he was just tied --n4034b1 up to a post###.###oh, yeah.###.###so we gave him to, uh,###i don't know if you've,###there is a place out here, uh, called shorties lane out here in harrisville###.###uh-huh.###.###and they have, uh,###i guess it's kind of an animal shelter###but he just takes a few the animals in
153149:6	and some he keeps --n4038c8.	###uh, the kids couldn't handle him###and i was still going to school###and my wife was working###and i was working###and so we just didn't have time to really train him --n4032c1###so he was kind of jus-, you know, he was too big for the kids to handle --n4033b1,###so he was just tied --n4034b1 up to a post###.###oh, yeah.###.###so we gave him to, uh,###i don't know if you've,###there is a place out here, uh, called shorties lane out here in harrisville###.###uh-huh.###.###and they have, uh,###i guess it's kind of an animal shelter###but he just takes a few the animals in###and some he destroys --n40387e
153227:28	because i mean i do think that some people need them and, like, for protection and stuff	###yeah.###.###uh, and i know, i know that like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released --n400ef3 from a mental hospital the day before. you know, be, be obviously insane,### and then, you, you know but have your legal right to get a gun.###.###huh. i didn't know that.###well, that's pretty scary.###so, does, now do they want us to say where we feel --n40132b about it, like in --n401346 rating it one to ten.###.###uh, yeah,### i'd probably, i'd probably say about a five.###.###that's where i would probably be --n401592.###.### seems like it's a good safe number to pick --n401634, you know.###.###well, i mean, i mean i don't really know what they can, how they can really enforce the laws any better --n401763###.###uh-huh.###.
153721:83	they, i guess they passed a couple of, uh, uh, laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go --n402a38 to buy a hand gun --n402a53	###.###i guess i am about eight or nine.###.###yeah,### i, i agree with you there.###.###yeah,###no doubt about it###but, uh,###.###i mean, if they can anyway get it, keep criminals from having guns which they can't --n402601###.###yeah.###.### i, you know, i'm not for it.###.###yeah,### if there's if there's a way, you know, to limited it to people that, i don't know that###.###.
153747:33	i guess, i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled --n4033b1	###they have a waiting period where you buy one --n402d32###and that's a week###.###uh-huh.###.###and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that.###i think that's a pretty good idea.###uh, and that's,###i don't know,###that's not a bad idea,###but then again you can always get around that.###you could go through the black market like you say.###you know, you always be able --n4031cf to get around###but, uh,###.###sure.###.###yeah,###it's one of things###but, uh, i don't know.
153785:23	you know, i have done some bow hunting	###it kind of takes the sport out of hunting.###.###yeah.###right.###.###you know, it's like what --n40390a can you do --n40391d with that, that you can't do --n403944 in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve.###.###sure.###.###you know, you might do the same thing.###.###right.###.###and so it's like, i don't know. it does.###it takes the sport out of it.###for me i would much rather have a bow anytime.###.###oh, really.###.### i, i like bows.
153940:46	well, even if it's not technical. if it's, uh, some social thing or whatever. it doesn't matter.	###like a liberal type of bias.###.###yeah.###absolutely.###uh, after all, who, who --n4022b3 writes.###people who --n402348 are journalist who --n40235b are trained --n40236a to write###and they're, that's a liberal, uh, a liberal field at least from academia###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, the other thing that i always notice --n402575 is that whenever they write about something that i'm an expert in --n4025b0 --n4025b7, i find their descriptions to be wrong###.###yeah.###yeah.###.###and it,###.### they, they generally make mistake on anything technical at least.###.###that's right.
154094:15	we have gotten some of our loans paid --n401cc0 off really because of this and stuff like that	###.###and so we are not taking a huge sum out, out of one###and then the next pay check we're real short###or,###.###right.###yeah,###we found that, uh, it's definitely helped, uh, get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses.###.###.###that's true.###.### we were, before we started --n401847 doing that kind of a thing, we were, uh, spending, uh, money for things that, you know,###we kind of tended --n4019fa to eat out a bit more than we should have,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###and it --n401af8 was easy to, uh, let things get out of hand.###we thought it, uh, thought it to be really helpful.
154338:10	i like some country music.	###i like her too.###.###uh,###.###i have been to a concert --n401880 a couple of times of hers.###.###i've never actually seen her in concert.###i imagine that she puts on a pretty good show.###.###she does.###.###uh-huh.###.### she's real good. she's real good.###so, i like her.###.###uh-huh.###uh,###.###.
154517:48	and, uh, i was kind of interested --n40017f to hear cause they had some people from the e p a and lots of different places	###.###uh-huh.###.###that.###so, i don't know.###.###so, uh, have you seen any concerts lately.###.###um.###uh,###.###.###hello ann.###.###hello chuck.###.###uh, the other day, i attended a conference --n400094 here at utah state university on recycling###.###uh-huh.###.
154542:30	they were able --n400d29 to sell it for some amount per ton	###.###uh, i didn't think that was a new revelation.###.###well, it's not too new.###.###right.###so, what what is the e p a recommending --n40055a now.###.###oh, they really didn't propose any solutions.###actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing --n4006ab even though he was from the e p a.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give --n400846 and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants --n400879 were being shut --n40088c down### and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about --n400a37 was recycling of, of news print.###he was talking about, uh, the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print --n400bca###.###yeah.###.###and they could sell it for a while.
154552:17	we --n401452're doing some here in, in cash valley, the community here.	###.###uh-huh.###.###but, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give --n400846 and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants --n400879 were being shut --n40088c down### and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about --n400a37 was recycling of, of news print.###he was talking about, uh, the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print --n400bca###.###yeah.###.###and they could sell it for a while.###they were able --n400d29 to sell it for some amount per ton###and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling --n400e06, they've collected so much news print that they have --n400e39 to pay --n400e48 to have it hauled --n400e5f away.###.###right.### that's a, that's a common problem though.### that it seems, that has happened in dallas as well as new york###and i try --n401181 to recycle all of the newspapers that --n4011a4 come to my house###and after a while i just quit --n401279 taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which --n4012ac isn't good for business on the other end either, i suppose --n4012eb.###.###yeah.
154565:99	so one of the real keys, it sounds like --n401a55, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.	###right.### that's a, that's a common problem though.### that it seems, that has happened in dallas as well as new york###and i try --n401181 to recycle all of the newspapers that --n4011a4 come to my house###and after a while i just quit --n401279 taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which --n4012ac isn't good for business on the other end either, i suppose --n4012eb.###.###yeah.###we --n401452're doing some here in, in cash valley, the community here.###.###uh-huh.###.### there's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up.###we've got a couple of plants --n40165e here that --n40166d actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation###.###right.###.###and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.###.###well, that's good.###.
154605:18	like a carbon fuel of some sort,	###.###and, uh, the solution that he came up with --n4028bd for plastics, and it was really quite amazing,###he says, well the best thing to do --n4029ed with plastics is to burn them.###.###oh really.###.###he came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume###so it takes up a lot of space###.###right.###.###and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling,###but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.###.###huh.###.###so his solution was to burn plastic. collect it and burn it.###.###well, it's carbon###so that makes sense,
154774:35	and i think that keeps a lot, some people from --n4026b2 exercising.	###when my wife lets me --n401fe7.###.###well, now who do you play with --n402057.###do you have friends that --n4020d0 play with you###or just,###.###no,###i just shoot around by myself.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, that's about it.###i use --n40227d to play soccer a lot in high school,###but when i graduated --n402324 i haven't done much.###i don't have a problem.###i know i have --n402415 to do more aerobics,###but i don't have a problem with weight.###i could eat all day and not gain an ounce.###.###well see, that's, that's th-, really good
154977:43	or or are you, or are they some home distributing the funds back to you.	###right.###.###okay.###.### on the, on primarily on soft drink, pops and that kind of thing###.###okay.###.### and, uh, so, they induce recycling of plastic and glass, soft drink containers.###uh, we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that --n40125c will accept tin and aluminum cans as well###.###oh, okay.###.### and actually the recycler, there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler, uh, with the handicapped group will also accept those.###so, uh, it's fairly, fairly extensive,###but then again it's uh, it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city.###.###so, did they,### you're giving, are you giving these products to the handicapped group###and the handicapped group is getting the uh, the money
154986:45	and then i, and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that --n401e19 do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well.	###uh, we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that --n40125c will accept tin and aluminum cans as well###.###oh, okay.###.### and actually the recycler, there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler, uh, with the handicapped group will also accept those.###so, uh, it's fairly, fairly extensive,###but then again it's uh, it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city.###.###so, did they,### you're giving, are you giving these products to the handicapped group###and the handicapped group is getting the uh, the money### or or are you, or are they some home distributing the funds back to you.###.###well, actually there's, there's the opportunity for both.###.###oh. okay.###.###generally the, uh, the handicapped group takes care of the things that###actually, the government has placed the deposit which --n401b8b is the inducement to re-, recycle the bottle so that you get your money back###and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit
155010:16	they have done it some, uh,	###but what they do --n4021e4 is employ, uh, homeless, i think mostly men, but homeless people to uh, go out and collect all the recyclable cans### and and i think it's mostly cans.###there may be bottles as well,###but like beer cans, soda cans and what not###and they, uh, bring them up to a one lo-, one centralized location and, uh, are able --n402561 to collect the money from the various beer and, and soda manufacturers and, uh, and get more money to these people that --n4025d8 desperately need it.###.###oh yeah.###uh, i guess partly because of our climate.###here in saskatoon at least, the majority of central, uh,###well, i want --n402948 to say central canada,###but central canada tends --n4029d3 to referred more to ontario and quebec###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people --n402ac2.###we certainly have a fair number of people that --n402bae are on welfa-, welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing.###uh, there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although, uh, scouts and hockey teams and ball teams, those kinds, uh, regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes --n402db2.###.###do they do it with news papers as well.###.
155019:10	uh, some of the,	###well, i want --n402948 to say central canada,###but central canada tends --n4029d3 to referred more to ontario and quebec###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people --n402ac2.###we certainly have a fair number of people that --n402bae are on welfa-, welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing.###uh, there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although, uh, scouts and hockey teams and ball teams, those kinds, uh, regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes --n402db2.###.###do they do it with news papers as well.###.###they have done it some, uh,###but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers.###they are actually at, virtually all of the shopping centers. like the shopping malls.###there are several containers where the group called cosmopolitan industries collects --n4031f3###or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins###and then the bins are collected --n403343.###.###huh.###.
155027:11	i have some friends of mine who --n400349 use quicken	###.###do they do it with news papers as well.###.###they have done it some, uh,###but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers.###they are actually at, virtually all of the shopping centers. like the shopping malls.###there are several containers where the group called cosmopolitan industries collects --n4031f3###or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins###and then the bins are collected --n403343.###.###huh.###.###uh, some of the,###.###.###uh, the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying --n40004e to put together a, uh, long term financial plan and monthly budget.###the only thing i do --n40019c now is, uh, put the data into quicken.###i don't know if you are familiar with that.###.###yeah,
155066:72	but, uh, we're to the point --n40171d now where our financial income is enough that we can consider --n401750 putting some away for college --n40176b,	###and occasionally we will get behind like you say###but, uh, it doesn't really seem --n400d54 to be too, too tight if we just remember --n400d8f to keep everything up, up to date and balanced.###.###uh-huh.###.###well, how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances --n400f76.###.###well, actually we haven't had --n401030 to. uh, until just recently.###i guess we've got a, a daughter who --n40110e is eighteen months and another one on the way###so we needed --n40122f to start --n40123e doing more of that just for, uh, you know, saving for college and things like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###we tried a way, try --n4013df to put away two and four thousand a year just for that.###.###yeah.###well that's pretty good if you can do that.###i know.###i have a daughter who --n4015d3's ten###and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point
155085:10	find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able --n401e36 to, uh, do it --n401e55.	###and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point###but, uh, we're to the point --n40171d now where our financial income is enough that we can consider --n401750 putting some away for college --n40176b,###.###uh-huh.###.###so we are going --n4018a5 to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall###.###um.###.###and then the money that i will be making --n40198d this summer we'll be putting --n4019ac away for the college fund.###.###um. sounds good.###yeah,###i guess we're, we're just at the point,###uh, my wife worked until we had a family###and then, you know, now we're just going on the one income###so it --n401d11's a lot more interesting trying --n401d34 to, uh,###.###uh-huh.###.
155092:75	well our situation is just a little bit, kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, uh, took on a full time job,	###um.###.###and then the money that i will be making --n40198d this summer we'll be putting --n4019ac away for the college fund.###.###um. sounds good.###yeah,###i guess we're, we're just at the point,###uh, my wife worked until we had a family###and then, you know, now we're just going on the one income###so it --n401d11's a lot more interesting trying --n401d34 to, uh,###.###uh-huh.###.### find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able --n401e36 to, uh, do it --n401e55.###you know, kind of enforce the savings.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, it --n401feb will be interesting to see mumblex.###.
155121:37	uh, a colleague of mine at, uh, work got some information over, uh, the computer network called internet.	###.###that sounds good.###but, uh, uh, i was just curious, what, uh, part of the country.###.###oh, stockton.###.###oh, okay.###.###how about you.###.###uh, cincinnati, actually.###i was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, uh, the western accents or something like that.###i don't know how many people --n40287f are, uh, getting involved in this###but uh, well that's interesting.###.###uh-huh.###.### i'm, uh, uh, actually, uh, i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by, uh, --n402a1e reading telecom digest###or was there another.###.
155148:17	we could talk about some of the long range goals	###and he just forwarded that on to me###and, uh, it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in --n402e6d###.###uh-huh.###.###so i sent back mumblex mail.###.###yeah,### it --n402fb8 will be interesting to see what, it --n402fe3 would be interesting to see how the data base,###.###.###mumblex so, well, i guess we're talking about the experiment.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, probably need --n403219 to try --n403228 to get back on the topic###but, uh, it --n4032ee's hard to talk about finances without without --n403319 getting to, uh, dollar figures i guess --n403348 you know,###.###uh-huh.###.
155153:60	uh, well i think, either my wife or i would like --n403632 to pursue advanced degrees at some point	###so i sent back mumblex mail.###.###yeah,### it --n402fb8 will be interesting to see what, it --n402fe3 would be interesting to see how the data base,###.###.###mumblex so, well, i guess we're talking about the experiment.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, probably need --n403219 to try --n403228 to get back on the topic###but, uh, it --n4032ee's hard to talk about finances without without --n403319 getting to, uh, dollar figures i guess --n403348 you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###we could talk about some of the long range goals###and,###.###well what other long range goals --n403562 do you have --n403575 besides college.###.
155201:43	we're trying --n400ea3 to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that --n400ee2	###yeah.###that's true.###.###uh, but, uh, no###i don't really have a budget at the moment.###uh, but i have uh, i have a rough feel for how much money i can afford --n400737 to spend --n400746 each month###and then i don't, usually don't exceed that unless i, unless the visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another, like if i have car expenses###and then that, then it goes through the moon,###so.###.###yeah,###that's sort of a problem.###.###yeah,###so uh, what do yo-,###.### we're trying, we're trying --n400c13 to, uh,###so far we are in the clear credit wise###but, uh, the other side of it is,###so, not much on that side of it to add --n400de5 to it.
155207:26	we'd like --n40107b to do that some day.	###and then i don't, usually don't exceed that unless i, unless the visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another, like if i have car expenses###and then that, then it goes through the moon,###so.###.###yeah,###that's sort of a problem.###.###yeah,###so uh, what do yo-,###.### we're trying, we're trying --n400c13 to, uh,###so far we are in the clear credit wise###but, uh, the other side of it is,###so, not much on that side of it to add --n400de5 to it.###we're trying --n400ea3 to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that --n400ee2###but,###.###so you can afford --n400fe0 to get a house.###.###yeah,
155408:25	so so there is some good to it.	###that's true.###i never thought of that.###yeah.###.### sometimes you know, sometimes the nursing homes are good for, uh, just short periods of time.###.###that's true,###until they get over that hump of whatever --n400bd7 it is --n400be6 they're dealing with --n400c01.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###because too often the acute hospitals will, are sending them out much faster than what they're really able --n400d45 to --n400d54.###.###yes.###.###.###they really are.###they don't like --n400ed2 to keep them longer than a week.###.
155436:87	if my parents were --n4017d7 to get ill, i would like --n4017fa to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help.	###what do you mean --n401217.###.###and they don't want --n401272 to take the responsibility###so they will put them in a nursing home.###.###yeah,###that's true.###.###so you see, uh, there's both sides to it too.###what do you think --n40147a.###.###yeah###and it depends on how, how sick the person is --n401500 too.###what you're capable of --n4015b9,###like if you have a family to take care of --n40163c, you know, of your own.###.###yeah.###.###yeah,###uh, i would personally like it
155466:19	and then there's also some that --n4022b8 are set --n4022c7 up for specialties	###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###so that, that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the, uh, either medicare or insurance --n401efb to cover it.###.###that's true.###yeah.###.###so,###.###but i think nursing homes can be good.###it just depends on what kind they are --n402146.###you know, you need --n4021cb to check them out ahead of time.###.###yeah,
155470:15	uh, i know some.	###.###.###yeah.###.###so that, that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the, uh, either medicare or insurance --n401efb to cover it.###.###that's true.###yeah.###.###so,###.###but i think nursing homes can be good.###it just depends on what kind they are --n402146.###you know, you need --n4021cb to check them out ahead of time.###.###yeah,###and then there's also some that --n4022b8 are set --n4022c7 up for specialties###.###uh-huh.###.
155471:9	unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, i guess it's --n402428 alzheimer's or where they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem --n402477.	###.###yeah.###.###so that, that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the, uh, either medicare or insurance --n401efb to cover it.###.###that's true.###yeah.###.###so,###.###but i think nursing homes can be good.###it just depends on what kind they are --n402146.###you know, you need --n4021cb to check them out ahead of time.###.###yeah,###and then there's also some that --n4022b8 are set --n4022c7 up for specialties###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i know some.
155471:117	unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, i guess it's --n402428 alzheimer's or where they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem --n402477.	###.###yeah.###.###so that, that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the, uh, either medicare or insurance --n401efb to cover it.###.###that's true.###yeah.###.###so,###.###but i think nursing homes can be good.###it just depends on what kind they are --n402146.###you know, you need --n4021cb to check them out ahead of time.###.###yeah,###and then there's also some that --n4022b8 are set --n4022c7 up for specialties###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i know some.
155521:29	and i i've seen some of them like that too	###but, uh, she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years###and then she decided that, uh, she's eighty five years old, that eventually, you know, she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and --n402f17 being a burden.###she's very independent.###so she's in this nursing home.###it's out in the country###and, uh, she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have --n4031e7 to wash dishes or cook.###.### gives her a little bit of her own independence###.###uh-huh.###.###but she still has, uh, a security there.###.###right.###some support.###and then there's also, uh, sort of a wing for those people that --n40344e do get sick###and, what i like --n403529 about it and i think she likes --n403550 about it is that she knows everybody there now###and then, so if she ever does become ill, uh, it will be like family around her.###.###that's right
155563:20	uh, guy, uh, some of my things, i, i'd like --n400052 to have a short work week you know,	###and it's beautiful###and, uh, i, i hope that i have something like that when i get older --n403cf4.###.###yeah### i, i think, i think the, uh i think that the decision that --n403e55 needs --n403e60 to be made --n403e73 though on nursing home has --n403e8e to be a joint one between the, uh, elderly uh, person who --n403ed1's going in and the family that --n403ef4's going --n403f03 to be, uh, effec-, effected --n403f2a by it###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh definitely it's,###.###and, uh, you know, sometimes it can, those choi-, those choices can be made --n404310 in advance###and sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're,###.###right.###.###.
155741:63	i think by --n40069c putting term limitations on you could, you could slow down some of the problems.	###so what i,###.###.###uh, so, do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time.###.###generally, i don't think they are.###uh, my, my personal opinion is that, uh, the politicians are out for their own good because they, they're entrenched.###.###uh-huh.###.###they don't ever have --n40032a to go out and get a real job.###they just stay in their current job,###.###uh-huh.###.###you know what i mean --n400466.###.###i agree, uh, with, with both of those things,###but, uh, do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest.###.
155746:10	i know some senators,	###generally, i don't think they are.###uh, my, my personal opinion is that, uh, the politicians are out for their own good because they, they're entrenched.###.###uh-huh.###.###they don't ever have --n40032a to go out and get a real job.###they just stay in their current job,###.###uh-huh.###.###you know what i mean --n400466.###.###i agree, uh, with, with both of those things,###but, uh, do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest.###.###i think by --n40069c putting term limitations on you could, you could slow down some of the problems.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, but it has --n4007fb to be not just at the national level but at the, you know, the state --n400846 and the local --n400859 level, too.
155861:129	but i, i think that there are, there are advantages to having seniority and, uh, turn-, or, not having a complete turnover every, some small number of years.	###yeah.###.###and, uh, you know, it, it's a, i think it --n403aa7's a mistake to move large agencies like that###.###uh-huh.###.###or is it the f b i.###i don't remember,###but i think there's,###.###well, i mean, l-,###t-,###i don't see why it makes a big difference the c i a --n403de9 because, you know, officially they don't do, they don't have any operations within the united states other than administrative.###.###yeah,###that's officially.###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, we all know that that's not necessarily true.
155962:19	and i think also some of the, uh, car companies are coming out with, uh, gas powered fleets so you,	###.###and muffler falls off or something###.###sure.###.###speakerb27-1*t27-1.###and guy keeps --n40158d driving along for long period of time after that.###speakeranan*t27-1.###speakera27-2*t27-2.###right.###i guess, from what i hear --n401676, though, uh, next year ford is coming out with their electric cars.###speakerbnan*t27-2.###speakera28-1*t28-1.###they're actually coming out with the first prototypes in california.###speakerbnan*t28-1.###speakerb28-2*t28-2.###yeah,###that,###speakeranan*t28-2.###.
156060:102	well, you also have the very close related thing of the, uh, rain forest destruction which --n4036b8 is the main source of what --n4036d7's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants.	###speakerbnan*t49-2.###.###i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles###.###speakera51-1*t51-1.###and it's, it's increasing even as far near the equator as like florida and cuba and those places.###speakerbnan*t51-1.###speakerb51-2*t51-2.###yeah.###speakeranan*t51-2.###.###so it's kind of an interesting situation.###.###it's not, not a real good one actually.###.###no.###.###but,###.###speakerb57-1*t57-1.
156086:35	well, not, not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the, uh, major pollution sources as you do out in denver --n403d83 with the inversion and los angeles and a-, rest of california which --n403dbe is just terrible it sounds.	###uh-huh,###yeah.###yeah,###.###you don't get that, that source of cleansing anymore.### are, have you been in big cities a long time.###.### mostly, i've mostly been in the east coast,###so that's going between atlanta, washing-, d c area,###.###.###okay,###so you've got,###.###a-,###.###yeah,###those are actually areas that --n403c0e are hit --n403c1d pretty hard, i would think --n403c40.###.###speakerb67-1*t67-1.
156270:17	i had, uh, some visitor	### had that invasion or whatever it is --n402c18.###.### sure was.###.###uh, but i, i don't know,###i guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype.### look at the, the smith trial.###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, that was a joke.###.###yeah,###that was,###but then you also have things where you, uh, where they broadcast the clarence thomas hearings basically the whole length of them --n403007 which i thought --n40301e was r-, really good.###.###oh, yeah,###the n p r doing that,###yeah,###i know,
156465:52	i mean, it --n40325f seems absurd that people will pay, you know, some bucks just --n40329a to get someone to,	###.###i don't understand the idea of paying somebody --n402d21 to, to do it.###.###huh.###.###it seems like it's absurd the number of people who --n402e46 end up --n402e55 having --n402e60 to pay somebody --n402e73 to do it.###.###r-,###all you got --n402fc9 to do --n402fd8 is read a book, i mean read the little book they send --n40301f###you fill in the blanks and go.###.###i,###.###.###yeah,###just the form.###.###.###yeah.###.
156639:7	but some of them have already been in youth centers. and that kind of thing,	###like, in, in,###uh, i'm afraid i think that there are kids who --n40220d just ought --n40221c to be taken --n40222f out of their homes and reared --n40224e.###uh, i know the institutions don't work that well,###but it's a bad day because i get all these kids through my office.###i have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids.###.###uh-huh.###.###five hundred of them are good, solid kids###and i have the same thirty-seven in my office every day.###.###um.###.###and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible.###some of them in the penal system.###.###so that's a difficult situation.###.###and, you know, you just see those kids going down the road.###now, not all of them will commit offenses that --n40288d have --n402898 to do with capital punishment,
156650:7	and some of them are our problems,	###um.###.###and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible.###some of them in the penal system.###.###so that's a difficult situation.###.###and, you know, you just see those kids going down the road.###now, not all of them will commit offenses that --n40288d have --n402898 to do with capital punishment,###but some of them have already been in youth centers. and that kind of thing,###.###um.###.###and if we had something to do --n402a89 before they get --n402a9c to be full-blown adult criminals,###and i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system,###i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think that's one reason we have problems in schools, uh,
156671:38	but if you could find a way to prevent some of it --n4034fe, and i'm not sure what it would be --n40352d. it would be money better --n40354c spent than,	###but a lot of it's because everything society wants --n402e6d, we are supposed --n402e84 to do --n402e93.###.###uh-huh.###.###but that's another subject###but,###.###well, that's probably true.###w-,###.###anyway, i dealt with two or three kids --n403089 today that --n403098 are going --n4030a7 to end up where somebody has, making a decision what to do --n4030e6 with them --n4030f5.###.###um, yeah,###i guess that's not an easy solution.### there's, there's no easy solution for that.###.###uh-huh.###.###.### i don't, i don't know that there is an easy solution,
156697:32	i'm for it in in some cases.	###.###that's true.###.###i'm sure it is,###yeah.###.###statistically, that's true.###.###um, yeah,### i don't, i don't,###certainly capital punishment isn't going --n403a75 to solve a lot of problems###.###uh-huh.###.###but,###.###are you for it.###.###uh,###.
156896:23	i think i've seen some statistics that --n400409 say that, uh, it --n400428's more expensive --n40043b to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life.	###.###.###uh-huh.###.### and that, and, uh, i don't know,###i guess i think that, that, uh, research is, i guess the most important, just because i, you know, it, it really needs --n4043ce to come to an end. you know.###.###uh-huh.###.###i don't know.###i don't know, fish.###what do you think --n404690 about that subject.###.### i think it's, i think it stands a really interesting question of, uh,###.###.###so, uh, you know, my feeling is that, uh, it's really being used --n40005e today,### it, it, you know, it, it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up --n4001d3 waiting on appeal --n4001e6.###.###right,
156938:9	but in some cases, yes.	###b-,###.###.###yeah,###but you also have --n401006 to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis,###for example, someone like, uh, jeffrey dahlmer,###do you want,###by putting him in prison for life, there is still a possibility that he will get out again.###.###yeah,### one, one way or another.###.###whereas if you kill him, there is not that possibility.###.###.###yeah,### but, but the other side to that is, if you put him in prison for life, there's a chance that he might do things in prison, or, you know, and somehow redeem himself.###.###yeah,###i don't think he could ever redeem himself,
157049:37	well, i, i think on some of it, you have --n405293 to say someone's responsible for his actions.	###.###right###and, the, the other thing is that, you know,###i was reading through a book on, uh, geneo, human geneo research###.###uh-huh.###.###and there, more and more things like schizophrenia###and why, does it just turn out --n404db9 to be genetic or biochemical in origin --n404ddc.###.###right.###.###so if someday we can go to jeff dahlmer and say, well, the problem is you, you've got an endorphin imbalance###and, you know, if you take this regularly, you'll be a sane and productive member of society you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###you really get back to the question of, you know, is someone responsible for their actions.###.###yeah,
157493:22	i've been out here twenty some years	###well, i'd be curious as to what the, uh, requirement for a, an acquittal is --n400f6d.###and i, i don't think it --n401077 would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.###but i don't know whether you need an, a unanimous, uh, vote of not guilty --n4013a8 to acquit.###.###yeah,### that, that would be an interesting change.###it was also allow the, uh, idea that if you had one person who --n401577 was, uh, very disagreeable that##, i mean, it, it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs --n4016b1 because, uh, the fact that it's w-, the, the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt, uh, criterion that it, uh, increases the, the likelihood of getting the proper judgment.###so, i, i think, if anything, it would have --n401a6a to be a very close to unanimous decision.###.###yeah,###i'd agree with that.###but i've never had the, the opportunity to serve on a jury, although i've been out here and registered for, i guess, about five years.###.###yeah,###actually i, i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do --n401e00.###.###but,###.###i would like --n401f0a to do that.
157511:156	well, the, the one thing that i know --n402ae2 does seem --n402af1 to happen from people i've talked to --n402b1c on this, is that in the situation you just said --n402b53 where it's nine to three, or some such number --n402b86, that there's, an effect --n402bad starts --n402bb8 being that there's starts --n402bd3 being a lot of peer pressure going on	###.###i would like --n401f0a to do that.###i've been out here twenty some years###and i've been called --n401ff7, uh, three different times,###but i've never actually even made it into the, the jury box. and, because there have always been a number of people###.###oh.###.### and, and i've never gotten up there --n40223d to answer any of the questions.###uh, i,###yeah,###i also think that would be really good.###i,###.###well, the people i know --n40242e who --n402439 have served have said that usually what --n40245c ends up --n40246b happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand --n4024ae, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying --n40255d to convince the minority that they're right###.###uh-huh.###.###and in fact, i'm not sure that that's any more, uh, liable --n40293f to get rid --n402952 of the reasonable doubt than, than anything else.###.
157516:9	and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire --n402feb of people --n402ffa to get out of there and not be stuck --n403025 in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons.	###.###oh.###.### and, and i've never gotten up there --n40223d to answer any of the questions.###uh, i,###yeah,###i also think that would be really good.###i,###.###well, the people i know --n40242e who --n402439 have served have said that usually what --n40245c ends up --n40246b happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand --n4024ae, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying --n40255d to convince the minority that they're right###.###uh-huh.###.###and in fact, i'm not sure that that's any more, uh, liable --n40293f to get rid --n402952 of the reasonable doubt than, than anything else.###.###well, the, the one thing that i know --n402ae2 does seem --n402af1 to happen from people i've talked to --n402b1c on this, is that in the situation you just said --n402b53 where it's nine to three, or some such number --n402b86, that there's, an effect --n402bad starts --n402bb8 being that there's starts --n402bd3 being a lot of peer pressure going on###.###uh-huh.###.###and that that, uh, peer pressure,
157519:107	i'd read one book, i think it was calls --n403230 trial by jury of all things, that, uh --n40325f went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases --n4032b2 looking at what --n4032c5 had, at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, uh, based on the deliberations.	### and, and i've never gotten up there --n40223d to answer any of the questions.###uh, i,###yeah,###i also think that would be really good.###i,###.###well, the people i know --n40242e who --n402439 have served have said that usually what --n40245c ends up --n40246b happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand --n4024ae, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying --n40255d to convince the minority that they're right###.###uh-huh.###.###and in fact, i'm not sure that that's any more, uh, liable --n40293f to get rid --n402952 of the reasonable doubt than, than anything else.###.###well, the, the one thing that i know --n402ae2 does seem --n402af1 to happen from people i've talked to --n402b1c on this, is that in the situation you just said --n402b53 where it's nine to three, or some such number --n402b86, that there's, an effect --n402bad starts --n402bb8 being that there's starts --n402bd3 being a lot of peer pressure going on###.###uh-huh.###.###and that that, uh, peer pressure,###and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire --n402feb of people --n402ffa to get out of there and not be stuck --n403025 in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons.###.###yeah,
157934:65	well, i do think with working parents it is, i mean, there are some real issues here. um, that i think, um,	###oh.###.###and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled --n401e0f.###.### which that,###.###i never felt spoiled.###.###.###in fact i always thought my toys were destroyed --n401f38.###.###i was going --n401fc1 to say, my sister wasn't spoiled --n401fec very much.###.###no.###usually busy fighting for survival.###.###yeah,###that's mumblex.###but,###.
157961:33	and it has, um, helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise --n402c80 that i think --n402c97 are wonderful particularly at this age,	###i'm a pediatrician.###.###oh.###.###my husband is a physician,###so, uh, i, i mumblex i talk to parents about this a lot.###but children,### i, i think working mothers or mothers who --n402642 choose --n40264d to work outside the home, um, need very early --n402680 to come to grips with any guilt, that they feel --n4026b3 and decide what --n4026c6's best for them and their family.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i feel when my children were very young --n402935, i had jobs that --n402950 helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing.###and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home.###.###uh-huh.###.###i really believe that.
158077:206	and i think that the people who --n401771 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level. uh, you know, whether it be a biblical force, uh, you know, the eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a knife, life type logic or just, uh, uh, some sort of anger at putting peop-, putting, uh, murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life, uh, while we foot the bill.	###uh,###.###of the statements made by people against the, the death penalty, um, i, i like the statement made by cuomo --n4008ec.###cuomo i believe --n400a27 is,###um, he's, he's governor of new york###but, uh, he's, uh, against the death penalty.###but, um, he said that he would, he would want --n400c13 to, to seriously hurt --n400c3a or if not kill --n400c51 someone if, if they did something to his wife.###and that's,### but, but, even, even in that circumstan-, in that, uh, uh, situation he would b-, he would hope that there would be people around him who --n400f0f would, uh, keep him from --n400f32 doing the, doing the things.###.###oh, it's a, uh, it's a question of your, your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response.###.###right,###exactly.###.###uh, a-, and that was the thing that, uh, --n40138a killed dukakis back, uh, four years ago when someone asked him a similar question --n4013d1###and he, he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when, uh, people wanted --n40154c to see if he was going --n40156b to go for an emotion uh, a gut level reaction --n40159e.###.###uh-huh.###.
158120:17	like say some young kids or something like that that --n403756 might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had --n403789 to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot --n4037f0 by a firing squad or something like that.	###and i really don't, uh, agree with that.###i don't think anyone who --n402b36 would commit a, uh, a crime that --n402b61 would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, i was about --n402bb4 to kill and dismember this person###but, oh, if they catch me they're going --n402da6 to kill me###so i better not do it.### i, i just, don't think that, uh, that it works that way.###.###yeah.###.###.###i don't think it's done --n402fef.###i don't think we run it as a deterrent.###i mean people say that,###but, i mean, if it was really a deterrent, i mean i think like horse thieves in the old west, you know, they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while.###.###uh-huh.###.###and if we really w-, if it was really seriously going --n4033ca to be a d-, deterrent, i would think that it would be public.###i mean i don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever, nobody ever sees it.###if someone ever,###if, you know,
158183:51	but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without --n4016d5 having some sort of, of discrimination or, or, you know, uh, appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff.	###they have.###they moved it up to the county north of here.###.###oh.###.###um, it's in ventura###and there's, there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously,###and it's kind of, it --n4010dd's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that, uh, that,###.###well, that videotape was just horrible.###.###yeah.###it was everywhere.###.###yes.###.###so you know,###and i, i think it --n4013a4 would be very difficult to find someone, uh, find a panel that --n4013f3 would be, not have seen it and, and known of what --n40143a was going on.###.###oh, i agree with you
158188:98	it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not, he's not getting a jury of his peers which --n401b00 is in some ways i think --n401b23 true.	###um, it's in ventura###and there's, there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously,###and it's kind of, it --n4010dd's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that, uh, that,###.###well, that videotape was just horrible.###.###yeah.###it was everywhere.###.###yes.###.###so you know,###and i, i think it --n4013a4 would be very difficult to find someone, uh, find a panel that --n4013f3 would be, not have seen it and, and known of what --n40143a was going on.###.###oh, i agree with you###but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without --n4016d5 having some sort of, of discrimination or, or, you know, uh, appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff.###.###exactly.###you know, um, the you know,### i, i'm kind of torn on this issue.
158215:60	but i, i rather imagine there's, there's some snickering about it. and a lot of the usually fatalistic, uh, here we go again folks, kind of stuff.	###.###exactly.###.###.###based on fact.###right.###.###.###how interesting.###oh.###so what's the prevailing thought --n402300 within the community.###.###um,###.###i mean you know, what the news media is going --n4023b4 to make --n4023c3 of it,###but what about the community.###.###they,###well, i guess it depends on who you talk to --n402523.### i haven't talked to, uh, i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it
158261:26	she, she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the, with the owner of the store.	###but that's, that's interesting.###.###yeah.###um,###.###what about the judge who --n40303b's hearing the case.###is he going --n4030d1 to be impartial.###is he going --n403142 to, be a go-, a good adjudicator.###.###.###i don't know. you know,### and, and again there's something else tha-, you know, there was a, uh, something else along those lines.###there was a girl out here named latausha harlins.###i don't know if it's, it's got, it's got as much notoriety###but it's rather almost as infamous --n40360f here as it was, as it was with, uh, the rodney king problem.###um, a girl walked into a korean owned store###and, uh, they, she had a dispute, black girl.###.###uh-huh.###.
158261:43	she, she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the, with the owner of the store.	###but that's, that's interesting.###.###yeah.###um,###.###what about the judge who --n40303b's hearing the case.###is he going --n4030d1 to be impartial.###is he going --n403142 to, be a go-, a good adjudicator.###.###.###i don't know. you know,### and, and again there's something else tha-, you know, there was a, uh, something else along those lines.###there was a girl out here named latausha harlins.###i don't know if it's, it's got, it's got as much notoriety###but it's rather almost as infamous --n40360f here as it was, as it was with, uh, the rodney king problem.###um, a girl walked into a korean owned store###and, uh, they, she had a dispute, black girl.###.###uh-huh.###.
158370:21	this child was crying and needed some comfort, you know,	###.###and they had a good system like so when you walked in --n401459, everything looks cool.###.###uh-huh.###.###the problem i had --n401544 was that they did not show affection to the children enough.###they did not show them care to these small children who --n401655 are being left --n401668.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, they,###one time i picked up this little boy who --n401788 was crying###and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other. you know,###.###huh.###.###he said you are going --n40191f to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up.###.###.###and i said, no,
158476:38	but they also did, they also did some of the teaching things	###.###uh-huh.###.###he would, you know, laugh with the kids and play with the kids### and and i-, it --n4039e6 was kind of interesting to see that, that it was actually the man in the group that, that --n403a51 did that side of it.###.###uh-huh.###.###an-,###.###yeah,###you don't see that much.###.###yeah,###so they had a really nice balance.###we liked that one.###in fact, it was called --n403d9c humpty dumpty play school or something,###.###that's cute.###.
158511:44	i think, i think there's definitely been some changes, um,	###.###uh, i can't remember what they call it --n4045e6 actually###but y-, you just stand them in front of a clock###and, you know, it has a second-hand that --n404754 goes around.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they have --n404817 to stand there,###.###.###well what do you feel --n400026 about the, um, present situation in the mideast.###.###well, it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is.###.###uh-huh.###.###what do you think --n4001ed, mark.###.###yeah,###i agree.
158550:31	and it must have reflected, uh, uh, some awful good, uh, diplomacy on the part of the u s.	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, i, we tend --n400dcf to be pretty strong supporters of israel ourselves,###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, we s-, kind of cringe when they make mistakes --n400ef9 but yet overall tend --n400f10 to support them.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was, you know, during the war, uh, in, uh, kuwait was, uh, the fact that they did not retaliate, for the, uh, scud missiles that --n40110b were, uh, launched --n401126 there.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###that just seemed to me --n401354 to be a, uh, a phenomenal, uh, demonstration of restraint,
158746:44	well i did work, um, just very mumblex for some time	###well, when you when you go out into the, uh, when you go out into the working world --n401364 it, it changes quickly.###.###huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###i'm sure.###.###um, you look at your paycheck###and you go, oh, my gosh where did it all go --n4015e5.###.###.###um, what kind of, what kind of,###uh, well have you pay a lot of in ta-,###have you been out --n4017c2 working and then gone back to school###or are you, did you go directly from high school into, into college.###.###i went,
158966:17	then i know of some of the people that --n401270 have gotten their masters	###exactly.###.###yeah.###.###what about you.###.###well, um, t-, i-, i'm research stuff here now###so what they, they have, uh, um, okay, benefits package.###it's not quite as good as industry###but one of the significant, um, benefits here is that you can take, uh, up to two courses a semester, um,###and they pay for you know, pay for the classes.###.###huh.###.###so, carnegie mellon that works out --n401057 to be, um, a reasonable, a reasonable benefit.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh, they do that i think --n401173 if you're, uh, research mumblex here
159038:32	but there's, there's some weird law where, uh, uh, student employees working for the government don't have --n402f29 to pay social security tax --n402f44.	###yeah,###and it's also, right now it's, uh, the,###like everywhere else, uh, here in pittsburgh the health care, uh, rates are, are going up pretty quickly.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's a whole other topic to begin with --n40288f too###.###they have.###.###but.###yeah,###but it's, you are right.### i, i, i really agree that, that that's pretty important.###.###well, the only, i think the, i guess the only real, um, benefit i guess you could say working, for me --n402bd8 working here, besides i mean###i'm learning and stuff because, i'm at, you know, in school.###.###right.###.
159110:25	and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars.	###.###mumblex help a lot.###.###.###yeah.###see around, around here it's like, uh, we pretty much work from project to project on, well, you know, with different sponsors.###.###uh-huh.###.### there's not, there is not a whole lot of, you know, funded research from,###.###.###okay.###so, uh, mike, what are your opinions on, uh, trial by jury --n400070.###.###well i work for an insurance company###so i see a lot of, uh, verdicts that --n40019b are pretty crazily decided --n4001b2. um, by juries particularly,###and i know in england the judges set all of the awards.###you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence,###but then they leave the awards up to more learned people.
159118:138	each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what, um, the going, you know, if you will the going, uh, award should be --n4008aa for a certain type of case, you know, within some kind of range.	###.### there's not, there is not a whole lot of, you know, funded research from,###.###.###okay.###so, uh, mike, what are your opinions on, uh, trial by jury --n400070.###.###well i work for an insurance company###so i see a lot of, uh, verdicts that --n40019b are pretty crazily decided --n4001b2. um, by juries particularly,###and i know in england the judges set all of the awards.###you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence,###but then they leave the awards up to more learned people.###and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars.###.###uh-huh.###yeah.### that, that seems --n4005d8 to make sense###but leave it up to the more experienced person who --n40068c knows how it fits --n4006a3 into the, uh, kind of the rate for different mumblex.###.###oh, exactly.
159124:81	who it really penalizes --n400c8a is their insurance company which --n400ca5 then translates into higher rates for all of us. if they get some of those mega awards against them.	###.###well i work for an insurance company###so i see a lot of, uh, verdicts that --n40019b are pretty crazily decided --n4001b2. um, by juries particularly,###and i know in england the judges set all of the awards.###you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence,###but then they leave the awards up to more learned people.###and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars.###.###uh-huh.###yeah.### that, that seems --n4005d8 to make sense###but leave it up to the more experienced person who --n40068c knows how it fits --n4006a3 into the, uh, kind of the rate for different mumblex.###.###oh, exactly.###each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what, um, the going, you know, if you will the going, uh, award should be --n4008aa for a certain type of case, you know, within some kind of range.###.###uh-huh.###.###when you get one way out like that --n400adb###but then really doesn't pen-, wind up --n400b71 penalizing the person that they went after --n400b94.
159138:19	and, uh, granted some people need --n4011a0 to be compensated --n4011b3 if they have really been wronged --n4011d2, you know.	###each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what, um, the going, you know, if you will the going, uh, award should be --n4008aa for a certain type of case, you know, within some kind of range.###.###uh-huh.###.###when you get one way out like that --n400adb###but then really doesn't pen-, wind up --n400b71 penalizing the person that they went after --n400b94.###who it really penalizes --n400c8a is their insurance company which --n400ca5 then translates into higher rates for all of us. if they get some of those mega awards against them.###.###right.###.###you know, they're not going --n400e74 to sit there and lose money.###if they are losing money, then they're going --n400f52 to raise rates.###.###right.### th-, they ha-,###.###so it all comes --n40108c filtering down to us all in-, individually.###.###right.###.
159140:84	well, how do you feel --n4012e8 about setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb --n40135b.	###uh-huh.###.###when you get one way out like that --n400adb###but then really doesn't pen-, wind up --n400b71 penalizing the person that they went after --n400b94.###who it really penalizes --n400c8a is their insurance company which --n400ca5 then translates into higher rates for all of us. if they get some of those mega awards against them.###.###right.###.###you know, they're not going --n400e74 to sit there and lose money.###if they are losing money, then they're going --n400f52 to raise rates.###.###right.### th-, they ha-,###.###so it all comes --n40108c filtering down to us all in-, individually.###.###right.###.###and, uh, granted some people need --n4011a0 to be compensated --n4011b3 if they have really been wronged --n4011d2, you know.###.
159146:13	you know some of the health insurance is written --n401659 that way. you know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it s-, pre specified in the policy so much	###right.###.###you know, they're not going --n400e74 to sit there and lose money.###if they are losing money, then they're going --n400f52 to raise rates.###.###right.### th-, they ha-,###.###so it all comes --n40108c filtering down to us all in-, individually.###.###right.###.###and, uh, granted some people need --n4011a0 to be compensated --n4011b3 if they have really been wronged --n4011d2, you know.###.###well, how do you feel --n4012e8 about setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb --n40135b.###.###.###do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts.###.###i don't know.
159156:45	i, i think it has --n401ed3 to be some kind of common sense applied there.	###right.###.###and, uh, granted some people need --n4011a0 to be compensated --n4011b3 if they have really been wronged --n4011d2, you know.###.###well, how do you feel --n4012e8 about setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb --n40135b.###.###.###do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts.###.###i don't know.###you know some of the health insurance is written --n401659 that way. you know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it s-, pre specified in the policy so much###but i don't know that you can necessarily put a, a value --n401888 on somebody's limb, uh, arbitrarily that --n4018b3 is always going --n4018c6 to fit in all cases.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think maybe you look at, uh, the age of the person and their station in life and, and, uh, how much longer --n401acf they have --n401ade of work years that they would have --n401b01 to put up, you know, with, with that --n401b34.###i mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old --n401db1.###.###huh.###.
159233:9	but in some instances you're going --n40351d to put companies out of business by --n403540 taking that stance, if they have --n403563 to take it out of their own retained earnings.	###oh, okay,###you're talking about corpor-,###.###and, uh, somebody is on the premises###.###sure.###.###and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift###and he pushes the wrong button###and he drops a load of lumber on somebody###and it injures, them.###.###okay.###.###.###well,###.###sure.###insurance should pay for that.###.
159263:34	and if, if they know some practice is wrong, you know,	###.###for, oh, th-,###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and unfortunately the ch-, the,###lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for --n403dca by insurance too.###.###uh-huh.###.###so again, it never really penalizes, the company doing the wrong.###.###right.###that will,###.###they can go right on --n403f9d doing the same old thing they always used --n403fc8 to --n403fd7.###.###huh.###.
159281:32	and, uh, then i had --n4002eb to do some volunteer work here in tyler, texas	###huh.###.###and if, if they know some practice is wrong, you know,###i'm not talking about your isolated occurrences,###i'm talking more about the, you know, the thing that they know --n404255,###maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know --n404354 is hurting people out there###and they continue --n40442f to do it even after they become aware of that.###.###sure.###.###.###okay.###.###then i think they ought --n404541 to have --n404550 to pay something out of their own pocket.###.###.###okay.###uh, before a couple of years ago, i had a, a very narrow view of, of nursing homes###and it was, uh, more like a funeral home.###i always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home.
159358:7	and some of the really nice ones that --n4020e7 really take care of their people are so expensive. because cause they can afford --n40212a to hire the people that --n402145 are really going to care for the older.	###and, you know, the nursing home was the, you know, best facility to put her in --n4019b0. you know, besides moving her up which --n4019df is not a practical solution since both my parents work###.###uh-huh.###.###and both my, uh, aunts and uncle work. which --n401be4 means it's, you know, very difficult for some-,###.###right.###.###you essentially need --n401d1b to have someone taking care of the person full-time.###.###right.###.###and, you know, there's also a lot of medical problems that --n401e26 can't always be completely handled --n401e45 in the home. which --n401e60 makes it, you know,###.###right.###.###it's a necessary evil i think --n402001.###.###uh-huh.###it sure is.
159588:39	i, i even like guns and roses, some of their stuff.	###oh, okay.###.###and i can, i can barely watch anymore because, uh, they have this heavy metal stuff on there### and, and i can't even, you know, i can't like that.###.###yeah.###.### and, and i liked, uh, aerosmith and led zepplin and, uh you know, and, uh, jeez who else is there --n401df5. van halen.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###okay.###.###.###okay.###yeah.###.###now i like, i like groups like that.###but when you get, uh,
159592:14	but, uh, some of these groups now like slaughter.	###.###yeah.###.### and, and i liked, uh, aerosmith and led zepplin and, uh you know, and, uh, jeez who else is there --n401df5. van halen.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###okay.###.###.###okay.###yeah.###.###now i like, i like groups like that.###but when you get, uh,### i, i even like guns and roses, some of their stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.
159816:30	i guess that's not large compared to some,	###have you ever head of her.###she's not rock###but she, she's from ireland.###.###no,###i haven't heard her.###.###.###oh, okay.###.###and, uh, she's gotten some, uh, she's been on like the top ten, i guess --n40573e, or whatever.###.###oh, really.###.### she, she did mumblex,###.###.###so, uh, do you happen --n40002e to be working for a large firm.###.###well, it's about three hundred and fifty people.
160087:28	uh, you know, as sort of some development and some training, uh,	###.###yeah.###uh, i guess we're here,###this is the university that --n40244d has, for years had the, the car, that, uh, --n402498 will travel the farthest on, uh, on a small quantity of gas,###our engineering students.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, in competitions###and that's the kind of thing that --n4026e9 also you see, uh, if you can see the kinds of achievements that --n40272c have been made --n40273f by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, whether you, you know, in one sense, whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a, a spirit of, somewhat unkind, but producing graduates.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.
160087:35	uh, you know, as sort of some development and some training, uh,	###.###yeah.###uh, i guess we're here,###this is the university that --n40244d has, for years had the, the car, that, uh, --n402498 will travel the farthest on, uh, on a small quantity of gas,###our engineering students.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, in competitions###and that's the kind of thing that --n4026e9 also you see, uh, if you can see the kinds of achievements that --n40272c have been made --n40273f by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, whether you, you know, in one sense, whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a, a spirit of, somewhat unkind, but producing graduates.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.
160161:27	but, i think there should be some kind of curbside service.	###uh-huh.###.###but, uh,###.###.###i don't believe that we're,###.###so what do you think --n400098 about, uh, recycling programs in atlanta, julie.###.###the recycling program here is just terrible.###i mean it --n4001cc's hard to find places to go --n4001fb.###i mean, kroger does a couple things.### they, i don't think they, do they do newspapers.###.###i don't know,### there's, there's big bins out there,###i don't know if they ever get,### i, i really don't know what the details are --n4005c8.###there should be someplace where you could call --n400689 and find out.###as a matter of fact, i'm pretty sure there's a place you can call --n400779 and find out the closest, you know, thing to you,
160477:87	and for the longer term i, i read, uh, like scientific american and, and, uh, readers' digest and some of those other types of magazines that --n401018 come out which, they,	###.### what about, what about you.###.###well, i read, uh,###i get a bunch of different things.###i get a newspaper every day###and i try --n40077f to at, at least have a few minutes to look through that --n4007c2###and i look through, uh,###i get a newsweek --n40090d every week which i, i pretty much read --n400938 that cover to cover###and i, as far as, you know,###that satisfies most of the short term news i get --n400ae5.###uh, don't watch much t v,### don't have enough time###and, uh, don't listen to the radio --n400c5b too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,###they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened###.###yeah.###.###and that's about all i ever hear --n400e5f of it.###uh, but most of my news probably comes from newsweek
160595:7	and some of it, i mean, is,	###.###yeah,###because, when they first start off --n403af9, they're going --n403b10 to be highly protectionist###so,###.###yes.###.###yeah.###.###and there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist,###even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, you know.###.###yeah.###.###like, england doesn't want --n403dbc to do one thing### and, and sweden doesn't want --n403e52 to do other thing###and they're, they've all got their own reasons which --n403f1a have --n403f25 to be resolved --n403f38 yet.###.###uh-huh.###.
160748:97	well, i, i mean, i think there's some people, there, y-, certainly are some things where you need infrastructure --n40232b	###and also, you know, then you figure out seven or eight percent for f i c a which --n401bba is taxes where you,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###most people forget about them, because you've g-, you know, you can't always get your f i c a back at the end of the year.###.###right.###.### but, so, you know, and then, you know, like a five percent surtax,###i'm paying forty percent tax.###.###yeah,###which --n402051 is just outrageous###and a lot of it,###and if you look at the way the government is run --n40211f --n402126 these days, it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste.###.###yeah,
160988:9	but also some poodles, uh	###uh-huh.###.###yeah,###shelties are nice.###everybody seems --n4013db to be really happy with them.###they're good temperament.###.###they're a good temperament###.###they put up with a lot.###.### and they, and they just, uh,###they, i think they have a good head on their shoulders.###i think they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, uh, dogs that i have encountered --n4016d2.###.###schnauzers, in particular probably.###.###well, yeah,###.###.
160993:10	there are some smart ones out there,	###they're good temperament.###.###they're a good temperament###.###they put up with a lot.###.### and they, and they just, uh,###they, i think they have a good head on their shoulders.###i think they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, uh, dogs that i have encountered --n4016d2.###.###schnauzers, in particular probably.###.###well, yeah,###.###.###but also some poodles, uh###.###oh, yeah.###.###they're kind of,
160994:25	but there's some also some, uh, not so smart ones.	###.###they're a good temperament###.###they put up with a lot.###.### and they, and they just, uh,###they, i think they have a good head on their shoulders.###i think they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, uh, dogs that i have encountered --n4016d2.###.###schnauzers, in particular probably.###.###well, yeah,###.###.###but also some poodles, uh###.###oh, yeah.###.###they're kind of,###there are some smart ones out there,
161001:72	that's, that's, maybe that's, there's, uh, some credence in that statement.	###i think they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, uh, dogs that i have encountered --n4016d2.###.###schnauzers, in particular probably.###.###well, yeah,###.###.###but also some poodles, uh###.###oh, yeah.###.###they're kind of,###there are some smart ones out there,###but there's some also some, uh, not so smart ones.###.###yeah,###i g-,###it seems the smaller the are --n401aa9, the, the worse off they are --n401ad0.###.###yeah,
161018:14	i mean, some people seem fairly well suited for for, uh, miniature poodles and such.	###it seems the smaller the are --n401aa9, the, the worse off they are --n401ad0.###.###yeah,### that's, that's, maybe that's, there's, uh, some credence in that statement.###.###yeah,### the-, they're bred --n401d84 down so much.###it's,###.###uh-huh.###.###they aren't the best pets.###.### i, i'd, i really don't know what the best pet is --n401ef2.###.###yeah.###.###i guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal --n40202c.###.###yeah,
161045:13	well, because some people, uh, want --n402b20 to train them as,	###pit bull.###.###.###they might,###they're actually very friendly dogs.###.###are they really.###i don't think i've ever seen one.###.###uh, they're really nice.###.###.### i, i've dealt with quite a few of them.### people, uh, customers that --n402778 bring them into the shop and ask me like, they, uh, fit collars and stuff on them###and they are, they are just really nice, really friendly, uh, kind of like medium intelligence. uh,###.###well, how do they become s-,###w-,###how did they get their reputation --n402a95, then.###.
161106:35	they're banned --n403947 from, in some areas i understand --n40396e.	### i was, i was overwhelmed --n4035c2.###.###i,###.###.###huh, well, i suppose you were surprised --n403688.###.###.###yeah.###.###after the reputation that, you know###.###yeah,###right now,###.###they have quite an, uh, uh, notable reputation as far as, you know,###.###they picked up a lot of bad press lately.###.###yeah,
161183:38	well, you should, you should have some opinions on that, then.	###it --n4049c9's too bad it happened, though.###.###yeah,###because then the, the animal --n404a8f's in trouble, and not the person.###.###right.###.###.### go ahead.###.###oh, okay.###yeah,###the, uh, subject is child care and how to determine child care --n4000d6,###and that's, uh, an interesting one for me to talk about --n4001aa since i have no children,###but i did run a child care facility for a while.###.###um.###.###and, uh, have some,###.
161185:14	i do have some thoughts on that,	###yeah,###because then the, the animal --n404a8f's in trouble, and not the person.###.###right.###.###.### go ahead.###.###oh, okay.###yeah,###the, uh, subject is child care and how to determine child care --n4000d6,###and that's, uh, an interesting one for me to talk about --n4001aa since i have no children,###but i did run a child care facility for a while.###.###um.###.###and, uh, have some,###.###well, you should, you should have some opinions on that, then.###.
161281:21	i'm into, uh, some industrial music that --n4005d4's, a, a bit even harder than that.	###all you have --n40310c to do --n40311b is have a sharp mind,###and i believe that, uh, mental acuity is easy to sustain, maintain --n403221, if you just simply continue --n403240 to exercise your mind.###.###oh.###.###so i think a person could work, uh, into the seventies, eighties, even nineties for that matter,###if they didn't have --n4034a7 to do a lot of physical, uh, labor, they could main-, maintain, uh,###.###.###so, what kind of music you into --n400032.###.###well, i have a, uh, pretty wide taste, uh, in music, ranging from progressive rock to jazz to, uh, lot of different forms of, uh, music.###in fact, it --n400258's easier for me to say, uh, the types of music that i don't like --n4002ab are opera and, uh, screaming heavy metal.###.###the opera, yeah, it's right on track.###i like classical,###but i can't deal with opera at all.###.###.###and heavy metal, uh, it's noisy.
161373:22	but i also dislike, uh, some classical music,	###.###.###yeah,###i'm sure that, that so-, that sold a lot for him.###that's all you really need --n402118 for a lot of, lot of pop.### i'm ki-, i've kind of like developed a, a short hatred for, for pop.###.###.###it just seems like there's no, no real point.###you hear the same, same tune over and over again in a thousand guises###.###uh-huh.###.###and,###.###well, i-, it's interesting because you were, you were saying that you liked classical music###.###uh-huh.###.###and i like a lot of classical music,
161396:28	uh, and some of, some stuff that i like --n402f01, uh,	###.###yeah,### i can, i can believe that.###what kind of things --n402a91 are you, do you like --n402ab0 in classical.###what's the standard --n402b7b.###.###uh,###.###.###stuff that i like --n402be6,###uh, i like bach.###i tolerate vivaldi.###i can't, stand, uh, uh, debussy or debussy.###.###.###uh, uh, i like tchaikovsky.###he can make a lot of noise when he's, uh, so inclined --n402dfd.###.###oh, yes.###.
161487:13	so you got some lakes around you can do that on --n400ba0.	###whereabouts is that --n40084a.###.###that's between houston and dallas.###.###okay,###all right.###.###it's the oldest town in texas.###.###is that right.###.###yeah.###.###wow,###that's pretty wild.###.###we have, uh, lake sam rayburn --n400a49 out here and lake nacogdoches,###so we do a lot of boating on.###.###okay,
161619:23	i'd like --n402d10 to do some sailing.	###i hadn't done any in a l-, uh, lately,###but that's all,###i used --n4025af to ha-, uh, have a friend that owned, --n4025f2 his daddy owned a boat shop.###.###yeah.###.###and we used --n402756 to, when i was in high school --n402781, we used --n402794 to go out, go --n4027b3 boating every day just about.###.###oh, that's great.###yeah,###i,###.###and we had a n-, different boat every day.###.###oh, that's fantastic.###yeah,###i used --n402aa7 to, uh, kind of be that way myself when i lived in, uh, north western florida in the panhandle --n402b0a,###i used --n402c01 to sail about every day.###i'd work, go to work,###.
161653:6	but some people are more motorboaters, you know which --n40397e is fine.	###or they just,###.###well, actually, i, i've known how to sail --n40311e pretty much my whole life.###uh, my family's pretty into it###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, i took sailing lessons when i was about six --n4032b6###and then, uh,###.###is it pretty easy.###.###yeah,### it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, you know, uh, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works --n40346f and, and the physics behind it --n403492.###.###yeah.###.###so it's, it's not too bad,###it's pretty easy to get the hang of --n403751, i think --n403768###and, uh, generally, everybody i've, i've known --n403852 has kind of gotten into it,
161668:20	you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people --n403e90 behind --n403e9b, the skiers,	###yeah.###.###so it's, it's not too bad,###it's pretty easy to get the hang of --n403751, i think --n403768###and, uh, generally, everybody i've, i've known --n403852 has kind of gotten into it,###but some people are more motorboaters, you know which --n40397e is fine.###.###yeah.###.###.###well, that's about all we have --n403a5f.###.###yeah,###yeah,###lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing,###but, then, again, they may nev-, m-, they may never have tried anything like, uh, catamaran###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, that's when you really start --n403d87 getting into speed --n403d9a. you know,
161927:62	but i keep, i keep --n403aeb thinking that there's got --n403b06 to be some way, that, that a lot of this is circumstances --n403b45.	### but, but the point that was, that it, you know,###you said that perhaps, uh, people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible### and, and i'm, i'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in, that --n403170 run the system have given up on it --n403197.###.###uh, well, i, i think the people that --n403370 run, yeah, that --n40338b run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical, you know.###.###uh.###.###i mean, i, uh, you know, i, i talked to a few people who --n4035bb worked in prisons and stuff###and it's, uh,###you can get pretty hardened, i'm sure --n403779.###.###but getting, i mean,###well, see, i always have problems because, because i can never decide whether or not i'm, i'm supposed --n4038ca to be a conservative or, or a liberal###.###but,###yeah,###.###right.###.
161976:69	stop --n404d07 trying --n404d12 to attack supply because, which, which to some extent --n404d51 makes sense and to some extent --n404d70 doesn't.	###.###speakerb73-1*t73-1.###it's a mess.###speakeranan*t73-1.###speakera73-2*t73-2.### i don't, i don't remember the, the gentleman's name,###but the, the, uh, the mayor of baltimore is a, is a rhodes scholar###speakerbnan*t73-2.###.###and what he,###.###is he the guy --n40496c wants --n404977 to, like, deregulate heroin, or something.###.###well, what he wants --n404a5c to do --n404a6b is take all the money that, uh, he gets --n404aa2 for drug enforcement and use it for, uh, drug education.###.###uh-huh.###.###and basically, just, just attack the problem at the demand side.###.###uh-huh.
161976:89	stop --n404d07 trying --n404d12 to attack supply because, which, which to some extent --n404d51 makes sense and to some extent --n404d70 doesn't.	###.###speakerb73-1*t73-1.###it's a mess.###speakeranan*t73-1.###speakera73-2*t73-2.### i don't, i don't remember the, the gentleman's name,###but the, the, uh, the mayor of baltimore is a, is a rhodes scholar###speakerbnan*t73-2.###.###and what he,###.###is he the guy --n40496c wants --n404977 to, like, deregulate heroin, or something.###.###well, what he wants --n404a5c to do --n404a6b is take all the money that, uh, he gets --n404aa2 for drug enforcement and use it for, uh, drug education.###.###uh-huh.###.###and basically, just, just attack the problem at the demand side.###.###uh-huh.
162002:32	and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans as well.	###.###.###before the one will take,###uh, okay,### let's see,###i guess, uh, i can start.### i'm actually, we're actually trying --n400187 to find one now because our family's growing.###.###are you really.###.###yeah.###uh, so i'm looking at, uh, something larger than what we have --n400329.###we've got, like, an eighty-four charger that --n400404's about gone and a, uh, an eighty-nine horizon.###so, i'm looking for something, uh, littler bigger,###.###uh-huh,###which --n4005ef are both kind of small.###.###yeah.###uh, so we were thinking mini van for a while
162162:42	it, it --n403dae's hard to beat some of the,	### and, and i never had a problem with it,###but, uh, my mother had a dodge at one point###and i, i had driven it a few times###and i really did not feel that it, that i would buy a dodge j-, just from,###.###um.###.###well, actually, i had a, uh, a dodge omni at one point###.###uh-huh.###.###and that was, i think --n4039ee, what --n4039fd really prejudiced me against american cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car.###.###yeah.###.###so, i guess you'd have --n403be1 to say, if i was looking, i would definitely be looking for a foreign car.###.###that's interesting.###but,###yeah,
162249:54	but, uh, there's a four o one k plan uh, for, uh, sheltering some taxable income.	###uh-huh.###.###.###what kind of a degree have you got --n400741.###.###i've got a bachelor's in electrical engineering###so,###.###oh.###.###and i'm not, like, a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, anyway, the, our benefits are pretty good.###we've got stock purchase program and a,### that, that's pretty generous, although you have --n400a78 to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which --n400ab7 is, kind of a, a pain,###.###uh-huh.###.
162314:57	i, i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that	###oh, yeah,###yeah.###.###so that you've got small, small things --n40196e to gripe about --n401981.###.###right.###.###wow.###.###and,###.###well, that sounds like you must feel really good about it.###.###yeah,###yeah,### and, and the dental plan is fabulous.###the dental plan, i pay absolutely nothing because, uh###.###wow.###.
162640:34	something i picked --n400589 up in a psychology class some time ago.	###uh, and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow,###.###right.###.###.###well, have you ever served on a jury.###.###no,###i've not.###i've been called --n4000f3,###but i had --n400146 to beg off from the duty.###and you.###.###well, i was called --n400207###and then i was not chosen --n400262.###.###um.###well, i was, i was, uh, originally chosen --n4002f9 primarily, i think --n400314, because i was a young fellow###and they tend --n400442 to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict.###i don't know why.
162645:62	it's that the younger they are --n4006a4, they tend --n4006b7 to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,	###well, have you ever served on a jury.###.###no,###i've not.###i've been called --n4000f3,###but i had --n400146 to beg off from the duty.###and you.###.###well, i was called --n400207###and then i was not chosen --n400262.###.###um.###well, i was, i was, uh, originally chosen --n4002f9 primarily, i think --n400314, because i was a young fellow###and they tend --n400442 to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict.###i don't know why.###something i picked --n400589 up in a psychology class some time ago.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah,
162662:71	well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such --n401077. i think there ought --n401096 to be a unanimous, uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this.	###oh, really.###.###yeah,###it's that the younger they are --n4006a4, they tend --n4006b7 to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,###and they kind of liked me.###i looked conser-, and all that stuff###and they,###i don't know what they saw --n4008c2 in me,###but they saw it.###but, uh, back to the issue,######is, uh,###i don't know,###at times i feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun --n400ac7.###but, there, too, there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule might be acceptable --n400bf5, particularly, i think in civil cases.###in criminal cases, i'd like --n400d47 to see the unani-, unanimity remain,###but in civil cases, i think a majority rule by, by jury would be sufficient.###.###well, uh, could you give me an example of a case where you think that --n400f5d.###.
163122:31	i think at each wal-mart, they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that, which --n4006d3 now,	###okay.###.###okay.###i don't know, really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in --n400143.###we live in the saginaw area.###.###saginaw.###.###uh-huh.###and i'm not real familiar with, uh, anything that,###i,###fact as far as i know, the school --n4003a4 doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. and, uh, or the grocery store or anything in this area,###.###really.###.###yeah.###.###the rec-,###we live in plano###and they started off recycling by, uh, --n400605 putting the,
163188:16	uh, i bought some cokes --n401fbb the other day in the br-, the little bottles you know,	###so you don't see too many --n40188d thrown out around the streets. or even bottles.###.###really.###.###.###you know, all kinds of bottles they, they, they really charge people to, i guess --n4019f1 when you purchase them --n401a08 and, and then when you turn them back in --n401a37.###.###right.###.### i n-, i remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel --n401c97.###.###right.###and now, now most of them are throwaway.###.###right.###.###.###so, maybe that's one thing they can do --n401e68.###.###i think now they're a lot more expensive than that.
163234:34	but i, i do know some of these places were doing that	###right.###.###they say that the green glass now, that there's a big glut of green the green glass,###.###oh, really.###.###.###of green glass.###.###yeah.###it's amazing.###.###well, out in this area, they really don't have anything.###now, i know that like minyard's and places like that around like arlington and fort worth and a lot of those grocery stores, they have like four different bins --n402d96 out front. uh, different colors for different things and, and things like that,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.
163289:195	and i, i guess i'll do this for, i was doing this for, actually, i was going --n403e7f to do it for my son so that he could, uh, he, he's in high school, so that he could make some money.	###.###we all do it.###.###.###well, it --n403a04 was nice talking to you.###.###it --n403a9a was nice talking to you.###i have no idea how long this is supposed --n403b44 to last --n403b53 or anything.###.###oh, i think, i think two or three minutes is fine.###.###i-,###.###.###is that it.###.###yeah.###.###okay,###well, it --n403d78 was nice talking to you
163367:85	but i think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have --n4010b8 to exercise some quick judgment in the field.	###.###and i'm an engineer there,###but i do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites,###but i don't operate any machinery.###.###yeah.###.###now, people for our company that --n400b22 do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a, a medical monitoring program,###.###uh-huh.###.###because they're at a higher risk of exposure###and blood screening is part of that###and i, i think that drugs,###they do test for drugs in that capacity,###but it's not their exclusive,### it's just part, it's just something that --n400ef6 turns up in the other parameters that they test for --n400f25.###.###yeah.###.
163414:55	i guess i k-, i think it's got some relevance,	###particularly, like, uh, we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol --n402666,###and tha-, they didn't find any problem with that, you know,###but,###.###right.###.###uh,###.### we, that's been an, a, an issue, uh, in our company even though we don't have the random --n4028cf or even regular --n4028e2 drug screening.###in fact, they'll have these little parties,###and people will just get,###i mean, i've,###my brother lives where i work --n402b89,###and i have many a time called him --n402c08 to come --n402c17 get me, you know.### and, uh, uh, but, y-, you know, they don't think twice about --n402d36 serving beer by the keg. you know,###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, i think drug testing,###and i, i don't know,
163434:66	they're, they should be able --n403a83 to make it as a continue of employment in some sense	### i guess i k-, i think it's got some relevance,###but i think its relevance is pretty limited.###i mean, i think, you know,###in your case, i don't think that you should necessarily be subjected --n4031ea to drug testing.###.###yeah.###.###i think that's an interesting policy your company has --n4032ea about testing immediately after an on the job accident.###.###yeah,### it's really, it's really bizarre.###uh, particularly, like where we are --n4034be, you know.### i, i,###there was a story of a woman last year who, who --n4035eb actually did slip on the ice and, and like sprained her ankle###and she, she was a personnel secretary###and she had --n4037cf to get tested --n4037e2###and, i don't know###i'm ambivalent about the whole thing.### i, you know, i have a lot of mixed feelings about###on the one hand, it's like if, you know,
163486:38	and, and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire --n400fb5 --n400fbc, the money will be there for us.	### or, or, or what do you think --n400198.###.###well, that's, that's a really hard question.###i do know that, uh, politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths.###uh, i### let's example, uh,###our friend, the president, right now, says no new taxes,###we should and especially, if anything, be cutting taxes now because of the recession###and at the same time, the budget he sent --n4005e9 to congress has tax and fee increases,###so, uh, i know the politicians, uh, aren't, aren't straightforward.###now, i-, in terms of economics i'm not,###it's hard, hard to call --n400879.###it really is.###.###uh-huh.###see, i never thought really, it's, uh, i never really thought that, that the, the question really had --n400a01 to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little.### i, i always that the, the real question was is, are we getting a reasonable return on, on investment.###for instance, like social security tax or soc-, uh,###i mean, that's, that's tax###we're paying money
163510:58	i'm not sure if we know what to do --n40200f in terms of curing some who --n402032 has already gotten polio.	###so that's,###yeah, you know,### when i, when i see that money taken out of my paycheck each, each week, i, or each, every other week --n401274, i, i really think that money's history###and you know, so as far as return investment, that's not, that's nothing###.###yes, uh,###.###and we're not even going --n401603 to get the exact same number of dollars back.###uh, someone was telling me that there is a, uh, uh, there's still an office in, uh, you know, staffed with, with people --n40176d there and, in d c that --n401790 are researching --n40179f to find a cure for polio, which,###i may be wrong,###but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded --n401a9f,### but, but supposedly once you have an office in d c, or, you know, and, and staff it with people, it --n401ba9's really tough to close it down### and, and they just haven't yet.###.###well, yeah,###i'm not exactly sure, uh, about polio in particular.###i know we have a polio vaccine come --n401edd will prevent somebody from --n401ef4 getting polio###.###uh-huh.###.
163519:33	that, that histor-, for some reason, historical sites with, you know, the, the full federal money and everything seem --n402542 to appear as, as almost as like political favors to, to very strong politicians.	###i may be wrong,###but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded --n401a9f,### but, but supposedly once you have an office in d c, or, you know, and, and staff it with people, it --n401ba9's really tough to close it down### and, and they just haven't yet.###.###well, yeah,###i'm not exactly sure, uh, about polio in particular.###i know we have a polio vaccine come --n401edd will prevent somebody from --n401ef4 getting polio###.###uh-huh.###.###i'm not sure if we know what to do --n40200f in terms of curing some who --n402032 has already gotten polio.###.###well, that might be the difference.###i don't know.###uh, the other thing that, uh, i remember --n40222d seeing --n402238 on t v lately is, uh, had --n402263 to do with,###it's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in america are in the home districts of very powerful people politically###.###right.###.
163528:86	so, it sounds like you, uh, you think that, that we'd be able --n402d85 to save some money by, uh --n402da8 passing the line item veto.	###uh-huh.###.###i'm not sure if we know what to do --n40200f in terms of curing some who --n402032 has already gotten polio.###.###well, that might be the difference.###i don't know.###uh, the other thing that, uh, i remember --n40222d seeing --n402238 on t v lately is, uh, had --n402263 to do with,###it's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in america are in the home districts of very powerful people politically###.###right.###.### that, that histor-, for some reason, historical sites with, you know, the, the full federal money and everything seem --n402542 to appear as, as almost as like political favors to, to very strong politicians.###.###yeah,### it's, it's, it's funny because, uh, it was one of the things that bush is trying really hard --n402848 to get ahold of --n40285f is the line item veto where, uh, you know, congress is able --n4028a2 to attach all kinds of, uh, funny amendments for individual, uh, c-, congressional districts to the, to the main budget proposals --n402921###.###uh-huh.###.###and the poor president has, has --n402c5b to, uh, either accept or reject the whole thing.###.
163554:48	the-, the-, there has --n403a4d to be some way to do it --n403a78.	###on the other hand, uh, it, it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your president not to veto important things. uh, and just to get rid --n4032d4 of the unimportant things.###.###yeah.###.###and whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment --n403486, there's always going --n4034a1 to be a dispute as to, uh, where the exa-, where the boundary between waste and, and necessity is --n403510.###.###uh-huh.###.###so i'm not, i'm not sure that, that that will help --n40371e solve our problems,###but there definitely is, is a problem with,###uh, i forgot,###there's a political term for this stuff, pork barrel or something.###.###yeah.###.###uh,###.###pork barrel politics.###.###pork barrel politics.
163627:37	i'm more, uh, old rock and roll, uh, some new, newer, i guess you would call it --n4008ce heavy metal rock and roll type you know, uh, van halen, that kind of thing.	###so that's about all i can feel apt --n400243 to discuss --n400252 with you since i just know,###i don't ever listen to the radio###and that's usually what --n4003ca's hot around here### so, so, what kind of music do you like --n400479.###.###oh, okay.###.###.###uh, mostly folk music.###.###folk music.###.###yeah,###i find myself, uh, listening to a lot of, uh, uh, either old timer --n400617 or new england --n40062a, uh, dance bands as well as, uh, just more popular folk music and new artists coming up.###.###uh-huh.###well, we're on totally different wavelengths.###.###okay.###.
163642:20	so, some some of the older eagles stuff was good.	###uh-huh.###well, we're on totally different wavelengths.###.###okay.###.###i'm more, uh, old rock and roll, uh, some new, newer, i guess you would call it --n4008ce heavy metal rock and roll type you know, uh, van halen, that kind of thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###what about, uh, classic rock type stations.###.###uh, i don't listen to the radio at all.###we live in a fairly small town,###so uh, classic rock for me is what i have --n400c45, which --n400c54 is like, uh, doors, eagles, jimmy hendrix.###.###oh, okay.###.###.
163657:14	but, uh, some of their older s-, stuff was, uh, you know, quite enjoyable to me.	###so uh, classic rock for me is what i have --n400c45, which --n400c54 is like, uh, doors, eagles, jimmy hendrix.###.###oh, okay.###.###.###so, some some of the older eagles stuff was good.###.###uh,###.###.###yeah.###.### i, i didn't like, uh,###they started --n400f21 getting a little more, you know,###the type of music --n400fd1, at least to me, it's, uh, sounds like it's --n40102c only sounds good at a high volumes###and i don't like --n4011c9 listening at high volumes.###.###yeah.###yeah.###.
163671:66	uh, so, anything new you like --n4016dc --n4016e3 --n4016ea coming out now, other than folk music, some i might know of --n40172d.	###the type of music --n400fd1, at least to me, it's, uh, sounds like it's --n40102c only sounds good at a high volumes###and i don't like --n4011c9 listening at high volumes.###.###yeah.###yeah.###.###but, uh, some of their older s-, stuff was, uh, you know, quite enjoyable to me.###.###yeah,###well they,###.###you know, ho-, hotel california and that era.###.###yeah,###yeah### that does, that's something you don't, --n4014eb doesn't even sound good --n401506 loud really. you know.###.###yeah.###.###you know, definitely.
163703:15	i think some of them, the artists are even, uh, hitting the pop charts.	### way, way more than i can stand down here.###.###.### i, i don't care for it at all, that texas twang or whatever you want --n401c40 to call it --n401c53.###i,###.###well, there, there's a conway twitty twang,###then there's the, uh, dolly parton, uh, hollywood sound.###.###yeah,###yeah,###that's more, even more commercialized --n401f02 for of country music.###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, it's getting, uh, uh, getting pretty big everywhere, as i see it.###garth brooks is outselling guns and roses###so,###.###yeah,
163824:55	see, that's one thing i like --n405280 about the, uh, some of the folk music scenes, you know,	###.### it's just, it's, you know, it's way to hectic and too confusing.###.###yeah,###so you keep --n404d96 buying the same artists until you don't like an album,###then you stop.###.###uh,###yeah,###generally,###or, about the only new music i hear --n404efe is somebody else that i know --n404f1d will buy something new that i haven't heard --n404f48###.###yeah.###.###and i listen to it that way,###but as far as,###yeah,###i don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless i've heard it.###.###yeah,
163880:10	there are some, but not, not very high.	###.###yeah.###uh, what kind of crime problem do you usually run into --n40072d.###any specifics.###.###well, uh, the least, what, from what --n400805's on the news, uh, there are very few, like actual robberies reported, uh, uh, of, of residences.###what --n4009eb's more likely --n4009fe to occur is, uh, robbery of, uh, you know, knocking over a, a small store or a car theft, you know, it, things of that nature.###very few, uh, assaults,###although on the college campuses, uh, there are, uh, cases of, you know, like people getting machine from a, from an automated teller and, you know, somebody trying --n400d6e to, to device a scam for, for, uh, --n400db1 getting the money for them that --n400dd0 actually preys mostly on foreigners.###.###um.###.###but mostly petty things and, n-, no, nothing, nothing really too big.###.###right,###well, i guess here we run into that sometime,###but i guess a lot of crimes are done --n40129a with apartment type break ins that type, not much home break ins.###.###right.###.
164033:47	i know they s-, they're coming out with some v eight now	###well, i think the next car we get --n400f00 will probably be a,###well i, i like buicks.###we have a buick century now,###it's a nineteen eighty-seven###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, whatever i get --n40110c, i want --n40111f to have, uh, air bags, uh, both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient --n40118a if you're carrying anybody to, you know, rather than have them stoop down --n4011d5 to get over,###so i think the four door is probably a major requirement###.###sure.###.###and, other than that, uh, you know, reasonable cost and safety and, uh, as much economy as you can get out of a car.###uh, you know, i'm not looking for one with a great big engine, uh###.###sure.###.###something that --n40173d will carry it around careful, i guess --n401768 is best, best way to describe it --n401797.###right now, we've got a v six###and it, that seems --n401945 to be just fine.
164038:17	so, they've got some pretty powerful sixes.	###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, whatever i get --n40110c, i want --n40111f to have, uh, air bags, uh, both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient --n40118a if you're carrying anybody to, you know, rather than have them stoop down --n4011d5 to get over,###so i think the four door is probably a major requirement###.###sure.###.###and, other than that, uh, you know, reasonable cost and safety and, uh, as much economy as you can get out of a car.###uh, you know, i'm not looking for one with a great big engine, uh###.###sure.###.###something that --n40173d will carry it around careful, i guess --n401768 is best, best way to describe it --n401797.###right now, we've got a v six###and it, that seems --n401945 to be just fine.###i know they s-, they're coming out with some v eight now###and i think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age.###.###yeah,###i was surprised --n401bad to hear that the v eights are coming back,
164050:47	but there's so many occasions when i've had --n4021e0 to move some members of the family or do this or that --n402217,	###something that --n40173d will carry it around careful, i guess --n401768 is best, best way to describe it --n401797.###right now, we've got a v six###and it, that seems --n401945 to be just fine.###i know they s-, they're coming out with some v eight now###and i think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age.###.###yeah,###i was surprised --n401bad to hear that the v eights are coming back,###so, they've got some pretty powerful sixes.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, you know, v eights seem --n401d12 to be a return to the days of, you know, ten or twelve miles a gallon.###.###right.### i, uh, i drive a, a truck, a ford truck.### i, i like trucks because they're spacious,###and it's handy to haul things.###uh, it's not related to my business,###i just really use it, basically, for transportation,
164073:37	and we weren't aware of it, and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car,	###sure.###.###.###is, uh, traction much of an issue for you up there.###.###traction.###.###mumblex.###.###uh, not really, uh, you know,###it's a two wheel drive truck###and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive, i probably ought --n402647 to be home anyway.###.###actually, uh, pretty good way of looking at it,###yeah.### we, uh, we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago.###.###wow.###.###a case where there was a, sort of freak ice storm --n402946
164075:14	so, we got some monster studded snow tires after that.	###.###is, uh, traction much of an issue for you up there.###.###traction.###.###mumblex.###.###uh, not really, uh, you know,###it's a two wheel drive truck###and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive, i probably ought --n402647 to be home anyway.###.###actually, uh, pretty good way of looking at it,###yeah.### we, uh, we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago.###.###wow.###.###a case where there was a, sort of freak ice storm --n402946###and we weren't aware of it, and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car,###and, this is a rear wheel drive model.

164095:28	so we've been able --n4030d3 to do some real creative, uh, load hauling when called upon --n403112 --n403119.	###so, we got some monster studded snow tires after that.###.###uh-huh.###.### haven't had any problems since.###.### what kind of, what make is the mini van --n402c29.###.###it's a mazda.###.###mazda,###i see.###.###and, uh, we're pleased with it in terms of comfort, and, uh, driveability.###fuel economy isn't great, being a mini van,###but, uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others###and it's, uh, got some nice features in terms of being able --n402faa to remove seats and flip them around###.###right.###.
164110:55	i think that we're going --n4039b1 to be, uh, owning a mini van for some years --n4039ec to come.	###but, uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others###and it's, uh, got some nice features in terms of being able --n402faa to remove seats and flip them around###.###right.###.###so we've been able --n4030d3 to do some real creative, uh, load hauling when called upon --n403112 --n403119.###.###one of my sons has a, a plymouth, uh, van or, you know, uh, uh, that same type of thing, the voyager, i guess###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###and, uh, they have a, a child that --n4033f1's five years old###and it's really handy for hauling him --n4034d7 around and, and their stuff,###and, of course, as he gets friends, i'm sure --n4035e0 that will be even handier.###so, i know if we were, if we had kids still at home, we're in our fifties now, but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have --n403754 to seriously consider a van just for their functional value.###.###yeah,
164185:22	i, in some ways, it's almost worse than murder.	###.###well, i've, uh, i've been caught --n401258 with marijuana before,###so i guess that was a crime.###i got a year's probation for that,###but, uh,###.### that, that's not that much.###i mean you know, those aren't,###.###no,###it wasn't that big a deal.###.###.###i,###.###uh, when i think of crime --n4015ee, i think of stuff that, that --n401615 affects other people like people getting, you know, killed or raped --n401650.###i think rape is one of the worst crimes.###.###yeah,###i think it is.
164259:34	but, i think you have --n40334a to accept some of the errors.	###.###uh-huh.###.###then, you know, there's been guys in jail for six years###and the other guy admits that he did it###and they,###it's like oops,.###but,###uh-huh.###.###well, yeah,###i mean, the system isn't perfect,###i mean, it's run --n403035 by a bunch of imperfect humans.###.###.###you do the best you can --n4030fc --n403103 to make it perfect, you know,### you, you go out of your way --n403210 to try real hard --n403227 to make it perfect.###.###right.###.
164345:22	well, i think that in some cases, it is warranted.	###they didn't have any time --n404bff doing it the first time.###.###uh-huh.###and i think locking them up for, you know, fifty years doesn't do a, any good because as a, as a taxpayer, i'm going --n404d31 to pay, you know, one and a,###.###no,###it do-,###.###.###okay,### looks like we're ready --n400044 to go.###capital punishment, uh,###the problem i have --n400116 with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed --n400151 to be a deterrent to crime,###but i don't think that it really actually does that.###i don't think it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes are, uh, are committed --n400369 with a, without any thought to the consequences###and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe i shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, i might get the gas chamber or something like that.###they worry about it afterwards###and then they try and get out of it.###and, uh, how about you.###.
164352:16	i think in some cases it --n400973 doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not.	###.###.###okay,### looks like we're ready --n400044 to go.###capital punishment, uh,###the problem i have --n400116 with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed --n400151 to be a deterrent to crime,###but i don't think that it really actually does that.###i don't think it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes are, uh, are committed --n400369 with a, without any thought to the consequences###and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe i shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, i might get the gas chamber or something like that.###they worry about it afterwards###and then they try and get out of it.###and, uh, how about you.###.###well, i think that in some cases, it is warranted.###.###uh-huh,###i do, too,###yep.###.###and i don't,
164368:12	well, for some things.	###i do, too,###yep.###.###and i don't,###i think in some cases it --n400973 doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not.###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###you still have --n400a9d to do it.### i, i,###.###i mean i mean, i'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer###.###.###uh-huh.###.###or,###.###so you're in, you're in favor of capital punishment, then.###.
164404:48	but, then, you know, i think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. you know, just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who --n401a60 abused them --n401a6f	###.###right.###.###.###and then do it all over again.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective.###.###right.### have --n40126f to agree with you,###and i'm kind of i-, in favor of capital punishment also.###i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes,###but, i tend --n401513 to agree with you that, uh, we should have it.### i just, i don't know that it's always effective,###but i guess we, uh, we're kind of stuck with it.### it's, it --n4017af's a difficult, uh, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going --n401806 to punish somebody for a particular crime --n401829, uh,###.
164636:52	although i, you know, i'm sorry --n402a2b to see some of their, uh,	###uh, if there's something you want --n401bd7 to know --n401be6, it's, it's in the times and then, and in detail.###uh, they, uh, we, we used --n401dcf to have two papers here in town###and then the herald examiner collapsed about two years ago because of, oh, i don't know, just nobody was buying it really.###.###so there really is only one major l a now.###.###yeah,###pretty much.###uh, there used --n4020d9 to be, fact, i think there still is --n40210c, the, uh, the daily news which --n402137 runs out of the san fernando valley###.###.###and, uh, they're not bad as far as a, uh, you know, as far as a local paper goes.###in fact, it was kind of weird, because i met the, uh, i met the, i met the editor, uh, while i was on, uh, while i was doing jury service in santa monica one time.###it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff.###he was a really cool guy. uh, you know, went to columbia university and all this stuff.###and, uh it's, it's a pretty good paper,###but, uh, you know, it's not, it's not the times.###.###yeah.###.
164770:133	one of the things that i found --n402a1b interesting last year during the, uh, the gulf conflict was a sentiment against, uh, peter arnett, who --n402a7a had stayed in iraq and was presenting, uh, some of the things that --n402abd were available.	###.###uh-huh.### which, uh, which approach do you find --n40211b to be, uh, more useful, the,###the interpretive approach or the straight reporting.###.###oh, i like the straight reporting.###uh, and then i, i hope --n4022ef to be able --n402302 to form my own opinion of it.### it's, it --n402411's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i always think it's humorous when, when the president gives the state of the union and, uh, for thirty minutes and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard --n4025d6 --n4025dd.###.###.###and a lot of time i don't hear exactly what they, what they write --n4027fc into it.###.###uh-huh.###.###so i, overall, i think i would rather --n402936 hear just straight reporting.###.
164858:59	there wasn't as many advanced placement courses --n401b79, uh, when i was a senior --n401ba0 that some other schools had --n401bbb.	###.###and s-, a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs###and it wasn't, we weren't too far removed --n40128d geographically from each other,###but the difference in schools i think --n40136a was pretty substantial###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, one of the things that --n401433 probably would have been better if, is if the entire county had had, had just one school system.###.###right.###.###and that would result in some, uh, could result in more equitable distribution of money###because what --n4016f5 was happening was, you know, all the very rich people went out to the, move out to the suburbs###and the city had a very low tax base###so they didn't have a lot of money to work with --n4018fb.###.###uh-huh.###.###as a result, the schools were rundown,###there wasn't as many, you know, of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked --n401a79.
164949:21	ended up --n404043 getting some scholarships to go to college --n40406e and which --n404089 has been, you know, which --n4040ac is really nice,	###.###uh, just, you know, they, they take a notion to do it,###they do,###and, uh, that doesn't work either, you know,###they have --n403c03 to have guidance###and uh, they can't just have it at school and then come home###.###uh-huh.###.###and there's nothing, you know.###.###yeah,###yeah.###yeah,###i know that that, that was a big factor for me.###i ended up --n403ee8 coming out of, of the public school system very well###and was very good education, uh,###.###uh-huh.###.
165232:33	the other thing i let them do --n4010b4 some times is that i let them go through and let them tell me what, let them do the diagnostics.	###uh, as far as maintenance tasks that i do --n400562 myself, i, i usually change the oil and wash the air filter###and i, i had an occasion to change, to have --n4006db to change the battery --n4006f2 once,###but, the brakes, i was really surprised that the brakes.###i wanted,###i do have the background.###i know what --n40094a needs --n400955 to be done --n400968###and i know that the oil --n4009ff needs, should be changed --n400a1a very regularly and all of the bearings###and the lube, lubrication system needs --n400b2e to be lubricated --n400b41###and so i, i stay on top of that###but i i wanted my front wheels,###i wanted the bearings packed --n400d0d###and they wanted something like fifteen dollars, uh, a front or something like that###or maybe it --n400e32 was thirty dollars to do it###.### just to pack the bearings.###.### just to pack the bearings,###but what i found --n400f8a is that they had a brake job###and they,###i had them,
165280:27	well it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that	###i bought the truck with about sixty thousand,###i have almost one hundred and ten,###so i drove on those brake pads for, uh, you know, forty-five thousand miles###and there was hardly any wear to them.###so those small little trucks and cars like that, they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good.###.###you know, they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much --n40223e###and the the surface materials on the pads is so good.###.### exa-, exactly,###.###.###so i, you know, i just did it anyway.### i like --n4024df to, i like --n4024f6 to stay up on it.###you know, like i just kind of stay up on it###and then if you go and like, just about any point, any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil, the oil is you might say, uh, a white golden brown.###you know, it's not dirty.### i, i, i keep it that way because that's, that is the key to the longevity.###.###right.
165513:41	and then with that i try and handle, you know, some of the clothes that the girls need --n402e4a and things like that,	###uh-huh.###.###and he, he has now for about, oh gosh, how long has it been --n40279b, ten years i guess.###but he was with another company before that,###but we have, we have,### i, i work also,###but i only have a part time job###.###uh-huh.###.###and i get paid --n402a94 very little###but, uh, you know, i try --n402b06 to use that money for food mo-,###jim gives me a certain amount money.###you know, we just transfer it into my account###.###yeah.###uh-huh.###.###and then i use that for food, household expenses,###and then i add my own check to that
165603:37	and then you have --n404586 to really sit down and plan some more	###not too bad. uh.###.###no.###not like she will later on.###.###yeah.###.###you will see that all of a sudden you're paying, you're trying --n4040f2 to decide whether you are going --n404111 to do, you know, soccer and piano and all these choices that they have --n404158 of activities to do --n404177###.###yeah###when,###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then you really have --n4043e1 to start --n4043f0 saying okay, now what can we afford --n404417 you know,###.###yeah.###.###what can we do --n404529 here
165653:14	i've heard some about saturns.	###i'd better get back to the subject.###.###oh, well.###.###but, uh, budgeting.###i found, you know, i feel a lot better.###you know, we use --n40519a to work out of one check book###.###uh-huh.###.###and it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have, i wouldn't have any idea how much money i was spending --n4052c6 in one month.###.###yeah.###.###now, i have, know exactly what i'm spending --n405449###and it's so much easier,###.###.###so. have you heard about saturns.###.
165687:30	and i found that while you can find some cars that --n400fc4 are comfortable to ride in --n400fe7, uh, finding a ca-, car --n40101e anymore that --n401031's, that --n401048's fairly easy for me to work on --n401077, it's just not very eas-, it's not very,	###.###um. yeah,###i've heard a lot of people like them.###uh, yet i don't know wh-, whether i would buy saturn or not at this point.###i'm kind of,###my card and, uh, desires tend --n400aac to be pretty picky###and so, uh.###.###well, like what.###.###well, let's see.### i li-, i like cars that --n400c2f are designed --n400c3e with, with human beings in mind,###.###.###and that's not just the driver and the passenger###but that's the person who --n400df2's working on it,###cause i do al-, almost all my own maintenance and, uh those types of things.###.###uh-huh.###.
165750:14	i've driven some, uh, tauruses --n40280c over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips --n402847. uh, as rental cars.	###it was about a nineteen seventy.###so i'm kind of, uh, biased in that###and, you know, i want a car that i can work on --n401fe7 because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed --n40202e anymore.###.###yeah.###.###and that's kind of, that's, that's probably one thing i'd look at --n4021ff.###i think another thing i'd look at --n402337 is safety.###.###yeah.###that's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about --n402432.###actually, the car, one of the cars we'd most like --n402517 to get --n402526 would be the new ninety-one ford taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that --n402571 have dual side air bags.###.###huh.###.###.###that's a real nice car, i think --n402761.###.###yeah.###.
165858:16	some, some local communities are very active in that, uh, in that respect	###.###uh-huh.###.###and the other one is, are the saturns.###.###uh-huh.###.###so those two things.###and then, you know, we kind of want a four door.###.###okay.###.###.###okay.###what is your, uh, community, uh, currently doing --n40005c with regard to recycling.###.###uh, basically, they're just, uh, having various recycling, uh, bins, uh, located --n40015b for, uh, trash pickup.###.###uh-huh.###well that's more than we have up here in massachusetts.
165904:126	i think here if they, uh, instead of just, you know, requiring that you put, put out the trash and stuff, if they --n4024cc could get some kind of rebate, those people who --n4024ff do put the stuff out, uh, you know, and separate it, have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate.	### they, th-, here they're trying --n401573 to push through a bill###.###but, uh, people need --n401666 to be more conscious of it.###.###and a lot of people are against it.###and it's going --n401780 to create a lot more work for the, uh, the stores that --n4017bf sell, you know, sodas and stuff.###because they want --n401916 to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything.###.###yeah.###mumblex it didn't, it, it took awhile for that bill to be passed --n401a56 up here as far as recycling bottles and cans.###uh, and, and matter of fact, i think it took like three tries t-, for it to go through.### but, and it's been pretty successful###and people notice it as far as, uh, highways being, uh, you know,###people would dr-, have a drink of soda,###instead of --n401f58 throwing out the window, they, they keep the bottle###so it's, it's been a ecologically sound policy and, you know, as, as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth.###but more importantly, it's recycling reusable materials back into, uh, manufacturing.###and that's the big thing, i think --n402308, that th-, they try --n402327 to promote --n402336.###.###right.
165945:32	now i think they've come up with some way of, uh, pulling the glue out.	###and phone books are a large volume of annual trash.###.###yeah.### they, they just,###matter of fact, that, that reminded me of an article i saw --n40365f in the pa-,###the local schools, you could send your phone book to your, uh, to, with your kid to school###and what they'll do --n4038ab is they'll recycle it.###because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that, uh, trash, uh, the telephone books are the type of thing that --n4039bc don't break down over a long period of time.###a guy went to a d-, a landfill, dug down five feet and, and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty###because they don't, they don't degrade over such a period of time.###.###well, part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made --n403e02 with a clay based paper.###.###yeah.###.###they contain the glue and stuff###and they used --n403f88 to have --n403f97 to take out all the, uh, pages and then cut the spine off --n403fda to be able --n403fed to recycle them.###.###yeah.###.
166085:182	and then, sometimes i, i often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. yo-, a microwave, a v c r, a answering machine a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,	###uh, but i i tend --n4024f8 to think that it's less --n402517 those people that --n40252a have the two cars and everything than it is the group that --n402561 is just trying --n402574 to survive.###.### yo-, so you think it's,###which group are you saying --n4027d4 is the one trying.###.###i'm saying that the, uh, the group that --n402899 is just trying --n4028ac to survive from day to day, where both parents are working --n4028e3 is more of the majority than the, than the people that --n40291a have the higher standard of living.###.###uh-huh.###.###because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who --n402ba4 has the money and who --n402bbf the decreasing, uh, middle class in this country i think that that's, in my opinion, the case.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###okay.###.###so.###i mean i have met people that, uh, both that, that --n402e35 just want --n402e44 to maintain a, the standard of living and those that, that --n402e8b really need the job.###.###okay.
166169:26	i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know --n402cf9 personally get paid --n402d0c an awful lot more than,	###uh, well, i don't pretend --n401959 to understand that either.###uh, but i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that --n401a2c ought --n401a37 to be blamed --n401a4a on the schools.###but then, again, i'm not quite sure where the blame ought --n401b92 to be put --n401ba5 --n401bac. uh, because the, the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-,###it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and, and crime --n401d75.###and they all seem --n401e44 to go together.###and it seems like if you could eliminate one of, of the parts of that circle, whether, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions --n401f5c, that things ought --n401f73 to get better.###so, uh, a-, the other two a-, a-,###they --n40224b're all three social issues and could be addressed --n402276 by the government in any ways. and clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to, to fix --n4022e1###but it's just like, i, i don't expect them to know which, which, which part --n4024a7 is best to fix --n4024c6 just like i don't know.### it's, it's a complicated issue.### i, i still don't think i would blame it directly on the school.###.###i don't know if i blame it on the school.### i think, i think i blame it, i think i blame it on a couple of different things.###i think i blame it on the school system. uh,###.###well, that's i meant when i said the school --n402b02.###.###yeah.###i don't blame it on the teachers in the school. i, although i think that,
166177:13	but there are some school districts out there that --n403059 are very well paid.	###but it's just like, i, i don't expect them to know which, which, which part --n4024a7 is best to fix --n4024c6 just like i don't know.### it's, it's a complicated issue.### i, i still don't think i would blame it directly on the school.###.###i don't know if i blame it on the school.### i think, i think i blame it, i think i blame it on a couple of different things.###i think i blame it on the school system. uh,###.###well, that's i meant when i said the school --n402b02.###.###yeah.###i don't blame it on the teachers in the school. i, although i think that,###i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know --n402cf9 personally get paid --n402d0c an awful lot more than,###well, they do quite well for themselves.###.###huh.###well, that's odd because i don't think the teachers in my school district, uh, were well paid.###.###no.###not all school districts are well paid.
166453:10	that's some brutal stuff there.	###yeah.###actually, uh, i kind of like soccer.###i've never really played it###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, i like the idea.### it's, it's an interesting game to watch --n403d25.###that and rugby.###i've like --n403e1b to watch, rugby every now and then.###.###.###yeah###or australian rules football.###that's,###.###yeah,###whatever you want --n403f54 to call it --n403f67 there.###.###yeah.
166634:38	oh, here's --n401b31 an easy way to make some money --n401b5c.	###right.###.###and nowhere does it say you h-, asks you whether you have permission --n4013ae or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i think that, it, it --n40156a's one thing f-, to, uh, voluntarily give it because someone asks.###you can always refuse###but it's another thing where it's required --n40173d by law --n40174c###and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody. you know,###.###right.###uh, that,###.### i don't think, i don't think they have the right to do that.###.###i agree with you there.###.###.###that's something that, uh, people have seen --n401a9e.
166636:43	i, i've heard, fairly recently, uh, some talk about that in this, in, in my state.	###and nowhere does it say you h-, asks you whether you have permission --n4013ae or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i think that, it, it --n40156a's one thing f-, to, uh, voluntarily give it because someone asks.###you can always refuse###but it's another thing where it's required --n40173d by law --n40174c###and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody. you know,###.###right.###uh, that,###.### i don't think, i don't think they have the right to do that.###.###i agree with you there.###.###.###that's something that, uh, people have seen --n401a9e.###oh, here's --n401b31 an easy way to make some money --n401b5c.###but, uh, i don't know if that's been challenged --n401c2b in the courts or not.
166762:101	because, uh, i th-, you know, i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of, do they still have some of their life left.	###.###well, he was until this operation.###he has arthritis.###.###oh, yeah.###.###and now i don't really think he's doing that well.###and my, a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him.###and i have one aunt that --n4008cc really looks after him a lot.###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, my great-grandfather was put --n4009ad in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three --n4009e0.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, died six weeks after they put him in the home.###.###yeah.###and i'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f-, grandfather's feelings.
166774:13	but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able --n401464 to deal with --n401477 physically anymore.	###but, uh, my great-grandfather was put --n4009ad in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three --n4009e0.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, died six weeks after they put him in the home.###.###yeah.###and i'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f-, grandfather's feelings.###because, uh, i th-, you know, i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of, do they still have some of their life left.### and and, for, for, i'm sure, a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over###.###uh-huh.###.###and i'm just here for the rest of the stay.###and so i, you know, i guess most of the time when i think about somebody going into a nursing home --n401137, it's more a case of where they are not able --n40116e to look after their day-to-day needs --n40118d.###yeah###.###uh-huh.###.###they have can look after a lot of things
166792:125	often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or alzheimer's disease or those or, or physical and mental handicaps. uh, you know, where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind. even though it may be minimal --n4022d1.	###.###they have can look after a lot of things###but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able --n401464 to deal with --n401477 physically anymore.###uh, i know my, none of my grandparents were in a nursing home.###they generally were able --n40165e to have someone care for them at home###and they died.###but they were all, goodness, younger than your grandparents.###like they were in their eighties. that type of thing.###uh, but i did, uh, you know,###i guess, uh, when i think nursing home --n401922 i do think of people that --n401941 are not able --n401954 to do, take care of themselves physically. uh,###.###but i just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job.###.###and that's, that's difficult part.###because i think what they often get used --n401c61 as --n401c6c is, uh, almost like a very high level or long-term care for, uh, similar to a hospital.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i know, like here in saskatchewan, we have our hospital care mumblex the care actually for the older people graded --n401e8a in level, in four levels.###and a level four type of care would be someone that --n402005 really requires long-term hospital care. generally are not able --n402034 to look after this-, themselves to very, to a very great extent, physically.
166799:28	at least, i mean i think some nursing homes do that.	###like they were in their eighties. that type of thing.###uh, but i did, uh, you know,###i guess, uh, when i think nursing home --n401922 i do think of people that --n401941 are not able --n401954 to do, take care of themselves physically. uh,###.###but i just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job.###.###and that's, that's difficult part.###because i think what they often get used --n401c61 as --n401c6c is, uh, almost like a very high level or long-term care for, uh, similar to a hospital.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i know, like here in saskatchewan, we have our hospital care mumblex the care actually for the older people graded --n401e8a in level, in four levels.###and a level four type of care would be someone that --n402005 really requires long-term hospital care. generally are not able --n402034 to look after this-, themselves to very, to a very great extent, physically.###often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or alzheimer's disease or those or, or physical and mental handicaps. uh, you know, where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind. even though it may be minimal --n4022d1.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, uh, but i think that it can be helpful in that, uh, it gets people the level of physical care they need --n402531. uh,###.###but i don't, i mean
166806:63	i think that a majority of the places in the u s, uh, you know, there is some government aid available,	###because i think what they often get used --n401c61 as --n401c6c is, uh, almost like a very high level or long-term care for, uh, similar to a hospital.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i know, like here in saskatchewan, we have our hospital care mumblex the care actually for the older people graded --n401e8a in level, in four levels.###and a level four type of care would be someone that --n402005 really requires long-term hospital care. generally are not able --n402034 to look after this-, themselves to very, to a very great extent, physically.###often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or alzheimer's disease or those or, or physical and mental handicaps. uh, you know, where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind. even though it may be minimal --n4022d1.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, uh, but i think that it can be helpful in that, uh, it gets people the level of physical care they need --n402531. uh,###.###but i don't, i mean###at least, i mean i think some nursing homes do that.###but i think a lot of nursing homes really, uh, are guilty of neglect.###.###yeah.### i th-, and i think it happens more in areas where it's, uh, i guess, uh, a broad social medical system where, uh, you know, there's government medical care and that kind of thing --n40293a --n402941.###if it's the lot where it's funded --n402b35 by the individuals --n402b48### and, and i guess that's sort of my lack of understanding.
166817:15	definitely does need some improvements.	###.###but i don't, i mean###at least, i mean i think some nursing homes do that.###but i think a lot of nursing homes really, uh, are guilty of neglect.###.###yeah.### i th-, and i think it happens more in areas where it's, uh, i guess, uh, a broad social medical system where, uh, you know, there's government medical care and that kind of thing --n40293a --n402941.###if it's the lot where it's funded --n402b35 by the individuals --n402b48### and, and i guess that's sort of my lack of understanding.###i think that a majority of the places in the u s, uh, you know, there is some government aid available,###but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, if you're not able --n402f02 to look after yourself, then you have --n402f29 to rely,###.###.###actually, to tell you the truth, i think, uh, jury selection is a, uh, prime, uh, discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on, uh, uh, finding of, uh, guilt.###.###uh, i certainly can't argue with that.
166876:51	i think that should be left --n4018a1 up to people who --n4018b8 have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have.	###.###so, if it's your peers and you're not educated then,###.###so if you're a nincompoop on trial, you'd, you'd have --n401053 to have nincompoops --n40106a to, uh,###.###.### you want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as --n4011e1 hopefully being honest people and do their best --n401208 to comply with the facts as they were presented --n401233 to them.###.###.###um.###.###so, that's why the defense is there --n401416 picking through them --n401429, whereas at the same time, the, uh, the prosecutor sitting there --n40146c picking through them because he wants somebody who --n401493 will give him, uh, a guilty verdict if the facts warrant.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, uh, i think the jury selection process is pretty neat,###but i don't think that the jury ought --n40179b to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards.###.###um.###.
166903:55	matter of fact, i've heard that, i've heard that some of the information --n402324, uh, is prevented --n40233f from --n40234a reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that,	###the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever,###but i think that it --n401d19 should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be --n401d84.###.###um.###.###maybe just the judge because they're the people who --n401ef4 know what the system is --n401f0f and what it's all about --n401f2e and believe in the system.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure. also, may be a more consistent sentencing procedure.###.###well, i suppose you may be right on that.###.###.
166971:48	um, s-, s-, naturally some, some things you just can't find --n400d8b in your local k-mart or, or, uh, bryn mawr stereo dealer.	###.###you get a guy down the street who --n403aaa comes up, uh, --n403ac5 carrying a kni-,###.###.###so, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the state of pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order --n400086###and after the fact, the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased --n400207 as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it --n400242.###what do you think --n4003f5.###is pennsylvania kind of out of line there.###.###well, actually, i don't think they're out of line.### de-, devil's advocate possibly,###but it, you are trying --n4005f6 to avoid --n400605 paying taxes###and whe-, whether or not you agree with that law, i-, you're still circumventing it.###you are legal in, in your circumvention of that law.###.### what, what if you're not doing it in order --n4008c4 to circumvent the law though.###i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase --n400a02 mail order.###.###really, i, i, i don't think that's a valid argument.###i think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax.
167015:43	and there r-, there are s-, some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try --n40317c to avoid that.	###well, i think that if, if policy is established --n4023c7 --n4023ce and if a mechanism is put --n4023ed into place --n4023fc to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then i don't argue with it.###because it --n4025ec's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, i bought this out of state.###i need --n402720 to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania.###.###which --n40282a is exactly what businesses do --n402845 at the present.###.###right.###but the point is --n402908 is that businesses do that.###the business that you purchase the thing from --n4029bf is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question.###that's a cost of doing business.###the burden shouldn't be placed --n402b9a on the consumer.###.###and i, i i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having --n402c6c to pay sales tax on it.###.###.###uh.###.###that's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works --n402e2f.###usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay.###but the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have --n402ffc to pay --n40300b.
167037:72	uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for --n403e04 policing themselves, then i think some well defined mechanisms need --n403e3b to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity f-, to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided --n403eb6.	###uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax. or purchasing.###.###i-, mumblex.###.###.###no.###businesses, uh if purchasing things mail order,###.###.### if, if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say utah. um, i, i might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have --n40365f to pay pennsylvania sales tax.###my a-, accounting department will at the end of the month.### i think that i-, i-, i think that's the way things work in pennsylvania --n403998.###and i know they work that way in, uh, say here in d c.###.###yeah.###see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't, i never see that end of the business.###.###yeah.###.###so, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer.
167070:58	to prevent these people from --n400702 ever getting out on the street. by, you know, some technicality.	###uh, i don't think they should abolish it.### i think, i think if they put it into force more often, they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got.###.###but not for petty theft.###.###right.###no,###no.###for major things like premeditated murder. mass murders. uh, you know, that type of thing.###i don't think it should just be used --n400420 loosely.###.###well, it should be used --n4004c2 as a deterrent do you think --n4004e5.###.###well,###.###or should it be used --n4005ac, uh, a-, to prevent further, uh, crime.###huh.###.###yes,###yes.
167074:12	and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again --n400899 doing the same they did --n4008b8 before.	###.###right.###no,###no.###for major things like premeditated murder. mass murders. uh, you know, that type of thing.###i don't think it should just be used --n400420 loosely.###.###well, it should be used --n4004c2 as a deterrent do you think --n4004e5.###.###well,###.###or should it be used --n4005ac, uh, a-, to prevent further, uh, crime.###huh.###.###yes,###yes.### to prevent these people from --n400702 ever getting out on the street. by, you know, some technicality.###.###.###and they go down the line ten years
167251:7	and some of the,	###but i thought, gosh, summer time, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.###well, all it ever did --n400f93 was rain and thunder storms.###.###.###and one thing is that we're, we had, we were going --n401080 to pour the basement foundation.###.###uh-huh.###.###and we're in the process###and it started --n40120c pouring down rain.###.###huh.###.###and i guess we had most of it done --n4012b3###but the end was result,###what --n401385 happened was that some of the, the wa-, a lot of water settled on the top###and it really didn't give a very good finish
167299:10	they had some property there	###.### and, and then materials coming in###.###uh-huh.###.###and so we're, we're hopping around pretty good.###but overall, yeah, we got it done --n401fe5###and it's a three bedroom, two bath house###and it's pretty neat.###.###nice.###.###yeah.###so.###.###nice.###so, uh, i mean what was it for --n402192.###you just,###.###well, it was, uh, for my friend's parents.
167359:42	and, uh they have put plastic, plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows.	###right.###.###have you,### what, what, are you putting --n402d15 in###triple glaze or double glaze or,###.###no.### we just, we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass.###my parents do not have a whole lot of money to put --n402f0d into it.###.###oh, okay.###okay.###.###and, uh, but it,###see in a lot of the windows.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, it's, the house is eighty years old###and it's had several owners and stuff
167692:31	uh, although i i'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity,	###i got a friend who --n400610 goes there, by the way.###i want --n4006b6 to as-, talk to you about that afterward,###okay.###.###okay.###uh, i've,###the high school i went to --n400816 was, uh, was a good one also.###and i, well, i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools.###because the one i went to --n400a93 was, you know, i'm sure a, a lot nicer than, you know, a lot of the inner city schools and the things around atlanta.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.### it was a, a, it's a more or less a suburban school system.###.###yeah.###.###yes.### that, that was true for mine too.
167700:59	and, uh you know, and so the students were, you know, to some extent, motivated --n40138d to learn.	###because the one i went to --n400a93 was, you know, i'm sure a, a lot nicer than, you know, a lot of the inner city schools and the things around atlanta.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.### it was a, a, it's a more or less a suburban school system.###.###yeah.###.###yes.### that, that was true for mine too.###uh, although i i'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity,###.###.###but i don't think, i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it.###you know, i think that, uh, i mean i know that in my town, you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education.###.###what d-,###.
167762:108	so, i guess the problem is the, the thing to do --n402fdb is to try --n402ff6 to, uh, to get some kind of motivation to learn	###well when i went to elementary school --n402762 it, it wasn't in a great area###but i still, i mean, i learned to read, started --n402881 learning --n40288c to read when i was in kindergarten --n4028b3, you know.###.###yeah.###.###so i guess i can't really i can't say what it --n402a87 would be like --n402a9a to, uh, grow up in a really oppressed region.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###you know, i guess the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the mumblex people.###.###yeah.###and i think that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably.###.###.###i mean, i don't, i think you know, people just,###.
167932:40	they'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense.	###you mean they could do that remotely.###.###yes.###.###.###yeah.### do it remotely --n40245a just looking at the,###what they do --n4024ff, they do several different types of things.###sometimes they put a source light###and they look at the source light###and then as the car goes by, you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it###and you can look at the emissions actually.###.###huh.###.###and...###.###now where does the source light go --n402800.###.###like across the street.
168081:38	if you have yard trash, you put your yard trash in some kind of container.	###.### which that's, that's what recycling at home sorting does --n401f10, you know.###.###right.###.###i mean it's a little extra work.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it can actually turn out --n4020e7 to be a lot of extra work because what they do --n40211a, what they do --n402131 here in sarasota county is they've got,###.###it can,###yeah.###.###okay,###you put your garbage in a garbage bag###and you set it out by the curb.###.###right.###.
168216:15	but they get into some really good conversations sometimes, you know.	### about an hour. about an hour south of tampa.###.###yeah,###that's,###.###.###okay.###.###uh, yeah,###well. i listen to this talk radio station down here###and it's really,### th-, they,###i don't if you ever listen to talk radio###but those guys, they just kind of get into, to s-, s-, stewing up trouble, you know. with the callers and things like that.###.###um, occasionally.###.###.###yeah.###.
168217:7	and some of it, sometimes it's serious	###.###yeah,###that's,###.###.###okay.###.###uh, yeah,###well. i listen to this talk radio station down here###and it's really,### th-, they,###i don't if you ever listen to talk radio###but those guys, they just kind of get into, to s-, s-, stewing up trouble, you know. with the callers and things like that.###.###um, occasionally.###.###.###yeah.###.###but they get into some really good conversations sometimes, you know.
168218:13	and they have some good feedback and all that stuff	###yeah,###that's,###.###.###okay.###.###uh, yeah,###well. i listen to this talk radio station down here###and it's really,### th-, they,###i don't if you ever listen to talk radio###but those guys, they just kind of get into, to s-, s-, stewing up trouble, you know. with the callers and things like that.###.###um, occasionally.###.###.###yeah.###.###but they get into some really good conversations sometimes, you know.###and some of it, sometimes it's serious
168236:157	uh, and really, i-, i-, we were really forced --n4001a5 into --n4001b0 keeping a budget because i'm, i'm paid once a month which --n4001fb sort of, sort of forces some, uh, uh, restrictions	###but they get into some really good conversations sometimes, you know.###and some of it, sometimes it's serious###and they have some good feedback and all that stuff###and from --n404b4e listening to that, i kind of got an idea that i thought --n404b8d would be good with###.###yeah.###.###and this kind of fits into the, uh, the aid program,###the welfare program that --n404d5f's going on right now.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's like, uh,###.###.###your turn.###.###oh, i, i start.###okay.###well, uh, we keep a budget to an extent.
168555:17	like i said, some years ago, i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country.	###yeah.###.###on the one hand i, i guess i admire the person who --n402ddf has the guts --n402df2 to do it because i couldn't i couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing###.###huh.###.###and i couldn't pull the switch###but, uh,###.###well actually i, wha-,###the other thing that --n4030e6 bothers me is when it becomes a political issue --n403111 because i don't really think it, uh, i don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else.###i think it just becomes a, uh, symbolic i'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians###so###.###yeah.###.###i would like for it to be settled once for all and, uh, get in the background while the more important issues get discussed --n403564, uh, uh,###.###right.###.
168569:28	i'm beginning --n403ccb to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, uh, that, uh, uh, costs and other factors justify, uh, uh, executing people.	###yeah.###.###i would like for it to be settled once for all and, uh, get in the background while the more important issues get discussed --n403564, uh, uh,###.###right.###.###like i said, some years ago, i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###now i'm, i'm not so sure of that.### i'm, i, i wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around.###.### what what's --n403a67 making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing.###.###.###uh, i guess i'm, i'm,###my view of, uh,###my,
168576:39	and, uh i can imagine that, uh, uh, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case.	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###now i'm, i'm not so sure of that.### i'm, i, i wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around.###.### what what's --n403a67 making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing.###.###.###uh, i guess i'm, i'm,###my view of, uh,###my,###i'm beginning --n403ccb to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, uh, that, uh, uh, costs and other factors justify, uh, uh, executing people.###.###.###yeah.###.###maybe it's more --n403ea9 a symbolic gesture that, uh, uh, than anything else###and, uh, i've also never been a victim although i have some, i have two friends whose wives --n403fec were murdered --n403ffb
168606:48	not so much because, uh, it's bad per se, although there is some pretty crappy programming	###actually in this modern day and age, it seems like, uh, uh, we have more and more leisure time because, uh, we have so many convenience, appliances and whatnot.###we don't even have --n40022b to cook dinner anymore.###.###yes.###yeah,###really.###.###uh, but i, uh, i've heard, i don't know this for a fact, but i've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together.###.###.### that ki-, the kids maybe on the average get, uh, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents.###.###that's what i've heard --n40067c too.###uh,###.###it seems bizarre to me.###i don't quite understand it, although i think probably the, the worst thing that --n4007ad's happening in the world, at least the modern world today, is television.###.###yeah.###.
168607:32	and i thin-, there's also some, uh, i think, uh, poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time.	###we don't even have --n40022b to cook dinner anymore.###.###yes.###yeah,###really.###.###uh, but i, uh, i've heard, i don't know this for a fact, but i've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together.###.###.### that ki-, the kids maybe on the average get, uh, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents.###.###that's what i've heard --n40067c too.###uh,###.###it seems bizarre to me.###i don't quite understand it, although i think probably the, the worst thing that --n4007ad's happening in the world, at least the modern world today, is television.###.###yeah.###.###not so much because, uh, it's bad per se, although there is some pretty crappy programming
168823:14	but there were some things --n401227 that people brought --n40123a up like well what --n401251 happens if they, they get a false positive, you know, what recourse do you have --n4012a0.	###.###well what about, uh, required drug testing, uh, as a, uh, condition of employment.###.###yeah,### that was, that, that was the other one i was thinking of --n400bdd.###i think that's, uh,###i mean i know drugs are illegal.###.###it mumblex thing actually.###uh, i, uh, have worked at texas instruments.###.###huh. uh-huh.###.###and, uh, they instituted a drug policy there. drug testing policy where they randomly would test, uh, employees --n400f2d###.###uh-huh.###.###and actually, to tell you the truth, i really did not think much about it.### i, i hadn't, you know,###it really didn't relate to me.
168838:52	and if they're, you know, if they're on some kind of, you know, contol-, controlled substance then, you know, it kinds of takes away from the job of, you know, the supervisor or manager type person, you know, who --n401df4 is able --n401e03 to evaluate them.	###uh-huh.###.###and actually, to tell you the truth, i really did not think much about it.### i, i hadn't, you know,###it really didn't relate to me.###but there were some things --n401227 that people brought --n40123a up like well what --n401251 happens if they, they get a false positive, you know, what recourse do you have --n4012a0.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, also, uh, uh, this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing, this kind of big brother activity###and yet, uh, a lot of these large corporations such as texas instruments, although they don't admit to it, it's actually, oh, a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure.###.###uh-huh.###.###so what that means --n4017db is, to me, that really it's the government that --n401812's requiring this,###although they don't actually e-, execute it themselves, it's really the government that mumblex.###so, in that sense, it, at least, philosophically, it's really borderline legal.###.###uh-huh.###well i, i think the, i think that, you know, a person's competence should be more determined --n401b7b by, you know, their actions and their behavior
168929:29	either you have, uh, military service or some sort of alternative, nonmilitary service for a few years.	###uh, i know that f-, because my son is a, a scout now and, uh, is thinking about his eagle###and, uh, in order to get eagle, you have --n400582 to have merit badges in, uh, citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation, citizenship in the world###.###right.###.###and you have --n40072c to do a public service project. uh, in which leadership is the key element --n400773.###.###uh-huh.###.### i, uh, i think the question is posed --n400878 somewhat strangely because, uh, it's talking about a requirement for public service###.###uh-huh.###.###and, of course, pe-, the peace corps, the boy scouts is a, o-, is a voluntary activity.###.###right.###.###uh,###.### i, i think that might be talking, referring to, uh, something, kind of, uh, alternative to the draft, you know.

169024:29	uh, i know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders.	###.###well, it depends on whether you, whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive, aggression oriented military.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right,###right###and, well, it's, it, it seems pretty aggre-, aggressive oriented,###i mean, you, you look at the last mis-, military action which --n40373b was in the persian gulf and wasn't anywhere near the united states###and it was, uh, you know, it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe,###so, at, at any rate, this is getting off the topic###but i-,### my, my point was that there is, for people who --n403b22 don't want --n403b35 to do the military service, there, it would be neat if there were an alternative that --n403b88 could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and, uh, sense of community that the boy scouts,###.###.###so, um, how do you feel about the crime in your city --n40004a.###is it, uh,###.###well, um, minneapolis isn't too bad.
169028:53	uh, that --n4002a4's kind of gone up in scale and, and some other things.	###.###.###right,###right###and, well, it's, it, it seems pretty aggre-, aggressive oriented,###i mean, you, you look at the last mis-, military action which --n40373b was in the persian gulf and wasn't anywhere near the united states###and it was, uh, you know, it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe,###so, at, at any rate, this is getting off the topic###but i-,### my, my point was that there is, for people who --n403b22 don't want --n403b35 to do the military service, there, it would be neat if there were an alternative that --n403b88 could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and, uh, sense of community that the boy scouts,###.###.###so, um, how do you feel about the crime in your city --n40004a.###is it, uh,###.###well, um, minneapolis isn't too bad.###uh, i know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders.###.###uh-huh.###.
169366:50	and i can, i can, you know, accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it --n402b42.	###.###.###yeah.###.###if you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print --n40223a is stuff that you probably knew --n402259 already and the stuff that you want --n40227c they're not printing --n402293 because the average person doesn't need or want --n4022be to know that much.###.###right.### doesn't want,###.###.### let me ask, by the way, just for the record.### i, i'm, i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them.###so, i mean, i'm not being elitist in that sense, i hope --n40275e. uh,###.###well, i mean, there's, there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes --n40288a to keep up on things.###.###yeah.###what,###.###and most people think it is
169411:107	we ended up --n403ece watching it for a couple of hours. zooming out and grabbing something to eat --n403f19 and then zooming back and ea-, watching it some more.	###something that you cared about --n4037b7 happened, you'd find out from friends or other channels.###.###yeah.###uh, i did, on the, uh, the supreme court hearings, ar-, the, for, uh, uh, the whole business of, uh,###see i actually have a, a,###.###clarence thomas or,###.###yeah,###the thomas and anita hill business.###.###right.###.### i, i mean that's, that's the closest thing.###i deeply cared about that.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and i sort of had planned --n403d3c to have dinner with a friend of mine###and when i arrived at her house --n403e18, she was engrossed in that.
169662:13	and they had some guy that --n404549 was, uh, defending himself.	###.###well have you ever served on a jury.###.###no###i haven't.###i never have.###my wife has###but i, i haven't.###.###uh-huh.###i got called --n404311###but i, uh, never, uh, got selected --n404374 for a jury,###.###uh-huh.###.###i sat for tw-, ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process,###.###uh-huh.###.###.
169714:12	and it was some malaria medication	###.###uh, i don't, i don't think they're very accurate###because, i mean, i know their lifestyles changed p-, prior to the drug test###and i know they changed afterwards.###.###right,###right.###see i know of that too.###and i also know that things like antihistamines, sudafeds, things like that, can really throw it off.###and you can not get a job because of it###and they may not tell you the reason why.###uh-huh.###.###yeah,### i, i had a friend,###it didn't cause her any problems with her job###but it came back that she tested positive for --n400f78 using a hallucinogen.###.###.###but what it was --n401023, was she had been u-, she had been, uh, in the jungle
169788:65	so you know, i guess you sort of, you have --n40307c to have trust some place along the way.	###.###the only way i can see it --n40260e is that if they really suspect a person of --n402639 using it, then they have the right --n402660 to go ahead and prove it###because they say they can spot check.###.###if you're using it while --n40285c at a job, i can see a problem.###.###yeah.###.###but the occasional person, then it's almost like, it's almost an infringement of your privacy.###.###well, it sort of is.###and this is it,###this,###i'm not real sure how i feel --n402b32 about it because i can see it from two ways.###you know, as a health professional, i wouldn't want somebody --n402c53 to take care of me that --n402c72 was using drugs.###.###yeah.###.###you know, so as a patient, i feel well, yeah, we probably should be protected --n402de0.###but, on the other hand, there's a lot of things i should be protected --n402eed from --n402ef8 that they don't test my patients for --n402f1f too.
169818:78	i mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of --n403b21 later on	###if someone was out --n4033bf to get you, i think that a company or a boss could use this.###you know, they could keep on --n4034e5 doing this to you or something, i guess --n403514.###i can see where it could become a problem --n403609.###.###and it, it's like, it seems like now they have tests###i guess they can test your hair###and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago.###.###really.###.###.###oh, wow.###but maybe you shouldn't be held --n403931 responsible for something you did --n403950 several years ago.###.###so,###.###.###i know.###.###that's the other thing.
169856:19	uh, but, uh, some friends of mine have, uh, gone through this.	###bye.###so we're, uh, our discussion's about, uh, the care of the elderly.###.###that's right,###that's right.###you know, what, what, uh, what do you think --n4001e4 is important.###if you were,###uh, i don't know how, how old you are --n400349,###but if you had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or th-, grandparents, whatever it is --n400481, uh, who --n400498 were ready, who, who you thought --n4004c3 might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think you would look for --n40050a.###.###.###uh, well i, actually my dad's, my dad's almost ninety###and he lives by himself###.###huh.###.###and he's in good shape.###.###yeah.###.
169857:78	i think i'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention --n400a78 and, uh, where they did some things --n400aa3 to try --n400ab2 to keep them, um, mentally alive --n400ad9. and where there was, uh, caring and compassionate, where there were caring and compassionate people, uh, operating it --n400b40.	###so we're, uh, our discussion's about, uh, the care of the elderly.###.###that's right,###that's right.###you know, what, what, uh, what do you think --n4001e4 is important.###if you were,###uh, i don't know how, how old you are --n400349,###but if you had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or th-, grandparents, whatever it is --n400481, uh, who --n400498 were ready, who, who you thought --n4004c3 might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think you would look for --n40050a.###.###.###uh, well i, actually my dad's, my dad's almost ninety###and he lives by himself###.###huh.###.###and he's in good shape.###.###yeah.###.###uh, but, uh, some friends of mine have, uh, gone through this.
169890:62	we used --n401bb3 to go once a month, once every two months --n401be2 to visit some of the patients there.	###and we go there, uh, once a year.### we see, we tend --n400fff to see her there cause we're in boston###so we're pretty far away.###when we visit minnesota --n40114f though we go --n401162 to see her.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it seems, uh,###i mean the, the environment there, i don't know too much about it###but it, it seems nice enough.###uh, it, it's hard,###at least half of the residents i would say --n40148b are not, not mentally sound.###so it --n40156d's hard to tell how much of that --n401598 rubs off on those who --n4015b3 are struggling --n4015c2 to r-, to retain, uh, clarity, say, uh, you know.###.###from the lack of stimulation, you mean --n4017c5.###.###yeah.###well i, i don-, i don't know.### we, we --n40192d also, my wife and i, uh, uh, volunteer --n401964 to go to a, uh, nursing home that --n401993's just a mile from our house.### we, uh, she goes more often than i.
169898:50	do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with --n4027a3, that the people who --n4027be operate it seem --n4027d1 to have, what you'd perceive of --n4027f8 as genuine concern.	###i mean the, the environment there, i don't know too much about it###but it, it seems nice enough.###uh, it, it's hard,###at least half of the residents i would say --n40148b are not, not mentally sound.###so it --n40156d's hard to tell how much of that --n401598 rubs off on those who --n4015b3 are struggling --n4015c2 to r-, to retain, uh, clarity, say, uh, you know.###.###from the lack of stimulation, you mean --n4017c5.###.###yeah.###well i, i don-, i don't know.### we, we --n40192d also, my wife and i, uh, uh, volunteer --n401964 to go to a, uh, nursing home that --n401993's just a mile from our house.### we, uh, she goes more often than i.###we used --n401bb3 to go once a month, once every two months --n401be2 to visit some of the patients there.###and we'd take, we have a two year old son###and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us.###and, uh, there i would say it's the same thing.### it's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment###but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who --n402040 are, who --n402057 are just e-, e-, essentially not able --n40209e to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on.###it --n4024d8's, must be depressing to, to walk, walk the halls and see, an-, and see all these other people who --n40256b really don't know where they are --n40258e.###.
169902:90	i, i think sometimes, you know, i've noticed, uh, people asking for, uh, some of the patients asking for things --n402c1f, uh, just repetitively and, but things that --n402c4e are not reasonable,	###so it --n40156d's hard to tell how much of that --n401598 rubs off on those who --n4015b3 are struggling --n4015c2 to r-, to retain, uh, clarity, say, uh, you know.###.###from the lack of stimulation, you mean --n4017c5.###.###yeah.###well i, i don-, i don't know.### we, we --n40192d also, my wife and i, uh, uh, volunteer --n401964 to go to a, uh, nursing home that --n401993's just a mile from our house.### we, uh, she goes more often than i.###we used --n401bb3 to go once a month, once every two months --n401be2 to visit some of the patients there.###and we'd take, we have a two year old son###and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us.###and, uh, there i would say it's the same thing.### it's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment###but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who --n402040 are, who --n402057 are just e-, e-, essentially not able --n40209e to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on.###it --n4024d8's, must be depressing to, to walk, walk the halls and see, an-, and see all these other people who --n40256b really don't know where they are --n40258e.###.###do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with --n4027a3, that the people who --n4027be operate it seem --n4027d1 to have, what you'd perceive of --n4027f8 as genuine concern.###.###i think, yeah,###i think they're relatively re-, respectful. yeah and, and concerned that, in as much as they can be.

169939:81	and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, yo-, you, you walk into some rooms --n403e58 and there's, it's completely generic.	###.###yeah.###i'll tell you one thing --n4037e7 --n4037ee though that --n403805'll, that, that i, i saw --n403840 that --n40384b was really nice.###we saw a husband and wife,###we used --n403a21 to see a husband and wife in there, uh, together###and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were --n403b0b###but these two were.###.###uh-huh.###.###and when you walked into their room --n403c0b, they had brought all their furniture from their house###.###uh-huh.###so it gives them a sense of identity.###.###and so,###.###.###yeah,###you walked in there
170022:25	a couple of times we've tried some things	###but, really, i'm, i happy, i, i, well i'm curious how other people live --n4008fc.###uh, so maybe we should start with you.###what do you do --n400add.###.###about the same thing.###.###really.###.###yeah.###.###oh.###maybe they're going --n400bb7 to arrest us both.###.###i'm even in worse shape because i have eight children###and, uh, we live from hand to mouth.###we hope that there's enough money --n400d78 at the end of the month to pay for the bills###and if there's not, then we mumblex due for the next month.###.###wow.###.
170188:13	we actually do some work with some people down at georgia tech.	###uh-huh.###.###the area i work in --n4005db, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.###.###uh-huh.###.###so that's make up most of the laboratory###so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small it's pretty small.###.###uh-huh.###.###what about yourself.###.###huh.###well, i, i work for, uh, --n400910 actually probably similar kind of place.###i work for, uh, lincoln laboratory.###.###oh, okay.###.###uh, yeah.
170188:22	we actually do some work with some people down at georgia tech.	###uh-huh.###.###the area i work in --n4005db, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.###.###uh-huh.###.###so that's make up most of the laboratory###so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small it's pretty small.###.###uh-huh.###.###what about yourself.###.###huh.###well, i, i work for, uh, --n400910 actually probably similar kind of place.###i work for, uh, lincoln laboratory.###.###oh, okay.###.###uh, yeah.
170245:32	so there should be something --n402725 in there or some kind of clause that --n40274c will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.	###yeah.###.###and i was reading this book --n401c8e one time about this guy that --n401cad had, uh,###i think the company still exists.###what they use --n401de4 to do --n401df3 is, they used --n401e0a to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to --n401e3d just laying people off you know.###.###uh-huh.###.###that way that, you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, you know, i think if they had programs that --n4020f7 set up --n402106 to subsidize people that --n40211d do get laid --n402130 off a little bit better, you know, other than s-, you know, something like,###unemployment is good###but i mean the company as a whole###because you as an employee,###even the company is making money,###they paying you a salary###but you are responsible for that company growth.###you're responsible --n40258c also for --n40259b helping that company get to the par-, point that it's at --n4025d6 at --n4025e1 making profits.
170495:48	and i don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some.	###i mean, there were five of us###and i don't recall, you know, --n403451 wanting anything in particular.###uh, but i don't know how my father did it --n403529.###he worked at a truck line###and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children.###but we did okay.###we had a house and a home and,###but now, my wife and i both work###and we don't, i don't believe we have as much as my parents did###and we only have one child.###.###really.###.###uh-huh.###.###well, things cost a lot more.###i don't know how it is --n4039d3 in georgia###.###huh.###.
170740:34	because i know my grandparents wanted --n400d99 to have some independence still.	###.###uh-huh.###.###well, i'm trying --n4002d8 to think.###my, uh, uh, wife's grandmother had alzheimer's###and they were going --n4003d6 to put her into a, a nursing home###and, uh, they, when they put her in --n4004c6, she had all kinds of trouble###and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a, a, you know, a, a nuisance. or worse than a nuisance,###i mean she sort of went, you know, bananas###.###oh they thought it was too much of a bother.###.###and they couldn't, couldn't deal with her.###so, i guess you need --n4009c2 to, uh, know whether it's a, you know, a no deposit, no return kind of thing whether,###.###right.###if they're equipped --n400b80 --n400b87 too, to handle the kind of patients you're going --n400bbe to have --n400bcd you know, put --n400be4 in there too.###.###yeah.###.
170744:12	they wanted some place they can go and have their meals --n400e86 and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her	###my, uh, uh, wife's grandmother had alzheimer's###and they were going --n4003d6 to put her into a, a nursing home###and, uh, they, when they put her in --n4004c6, she had all kinds of trouble###and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a, a, you know, a, a nuisance. or worse than a nuisance,###i mean she sort of went, you know, bananas###.###oh they thought it was too much of a bother.###.###and they couldn't, couldn't deal with her.###so, i guess you need --n4009c2 to, uh, know whether it's a, you know, a no deposit, no return kind of thing whether,###.###right.###if they're equipped --n400b80 --n400b87 too, to handle the kind of patients you're going --n400bbe to have --n400bcd you know, put --n400be4 in there too.###.###yeah.###.###because i know my grandparents wanted --n400d99 to have some independence still.###.###right.###.
170752:11	there was some sort of full-time care place that --n4011f7 was also associated --n40120a with it	###and they couldn't, couldn't deal with her.###so, i guess you need --n4009c2 to, uh, know whether it's a, you know, a no deposit, no return kind of thing whether,###.###right.###if they're equipped --n400b80 --n400b87 too, to handle the kind of patients you're going --n400bbe to have --n400bcd you know, put --n400be4 in there too.###.###yeah.###.###because i know my grandparents wanted --n400d99 to have some independence still.###.###right.###.###they wanted some place they can go and have their meals --n400e86 and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her###but they wanted --n400fb5 to be independent as well. have their own room.###.###right.###.###.###my grandmother actually was in a, a nursing home that, uh,###there was a retirement hotel and then a, uh,
170859:54	uh, i've had, uh, three boys --n40003a through, i guess, uh, some child care, each one of them	###yeah.###well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing --n4034fa.###.###it --n40363b's just a shame that's the way it has --n403672 to be --n403681.###i think the retirement home idea's a nice idea.### to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay --n403820###.###yeah.###.###and cause like if your spouse died, mumblex all alone, it --n40392f'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you. to have friends.###.###right.###.###.###yeah,###i've known quite a few people that --n403af1 have, uh, gone to retirement communities.###i don't know if they have them back there###but here in california and in ari-,###.###.
170873:29	you'd like --n40098b to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care.	###yeah,###i've known quite a few people that --n403af1 have, uh, gone to retirement communities.###i don't know if they have them back there###but here in california and in ari-,###.###.###uh, i've had, uh, three boys --n40003a through, i guess, uh, some child care, each one of them###and now they're in school###so it's all over###but, uh, i guess i would say it --n40020e's not easy to find wha-, what most parents would want --n400249.###.###well i can profit by this because i'm due with my first in about three months.###.###is that right.###i guess, uh, the only rule, uh, i can think of --n4004d9 is that i like --n4004f0 to look for places with, uh, good respectable, nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that.###if they're associated --n400703 with a college or a university, they're usually a pretty good bet.###.###huh.###.###uh, i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want --n400842 when you buy a car or refrigerator something --n400869.
170891:110	aren't don't they kind of use them for, everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs. for their per-, for their pet theories or some such thing.	###.###uh, i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want --n400842 when you buy a car or refrigerator something --n400869.###you'd like --n40098b to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care.###.###i guess not, usu-,###i suppose you're absolutely right there.###.###yeah.###for profit places, i would really look at them awfully carefully###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, when i was when my kids were young --n400c31, i was teaching at a university###and, uh, the child care center associated with our university was quite good###so i felt confident that they'd do right.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###of,
170937:25	and they finding, in some cases they're finding it --n40212d's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare.	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh.###.###uh, i, you know, i think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them --n401cb1###but###.###uh-huh.###.###i don't think it's as common as, uh, the newspapers would make you believe.###.###uh-huh.###and another thing is cost.###.###oh, yeah.###i mean that,###.###i know so many of my friends i went to school with --n401ff6 who --n402001 are having babies right now
171124:6	some of that is really bad i think --n40243e.	###so we keep --n401b3b moving.###we don't stop and wait for the things --n401bae to bake and this --n401bc9 to happen and that --n401be4 to happen.###we just hit buttons and keep --n401d23 going to the next thing.###so we have no relaxation time in between###.###uh-huh.###.###so they say that's really a bad thing. that you need --n401e6b to learn a lot of ways --n401e8e to, to deal with that and get your, your time in between things.###.###uh-huh.###.###so that's good.###that's an interesting point.###but i just think our, our family lives have changed drastically.###.###.###and i think that's ju-,###of course a part of it is technology.###i mean our kids, where would they be --n402301 without nintendo and, you know, their t v shows###and no-,
171199:29	well i think the court systems could stand some improvement.	###huh. well that's true.###but, i,###it's just very, very different###and i guess every ten years it's just been very different.###.###yeah.###.###so. and i don't know what --n403d7b's going --n403d8a to happen.###uh, i know what i'm seeing --n403e4e here at m-, my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers###.###yeah,###tha-,###.###and they've got their homes###and they've got,###.###.###why don't you go ahead and start --n400032.###.###okay.
171282:63	but i guess, i guess i like the system that they have --n402cdd in some places where the defendant gets --n402d00 to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets --n402d4b to choose it --n402d5e.	###.###.###well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent.###that's usually a matter of who to believe --n402524 and what facts to believe --n402543.###.###right.###.###but people who --n402637 d-, don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like --n40268a and what the options are --n4026a5, to ask them --n4026c0 to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see --n402703, i think that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.###.###yeah.###.###in texas here, people tend --n4029e8 to get whipped --n4029fb up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere.###.###right.###.###but in a lot of places, i think people bend over the other way,
171283:17	some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that.	###.###well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent.###that's usually a matter of who to believe --n402524 and what facts to believe --n402543.###.###right.###.###but people who --n402637 d-, don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like --n40268a and what the options are --n4026a5, to ask them --n4026c0 to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see --n402703, i think that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.###.###yeah.###.###in texas here, people tend --n4029e8 to get whipped --n4029fb up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere.###.###right.###.###but in a lot of places, i think people bend over the other way,###but i guess, i guess i like the system that they have --n402cdd in some places where the defendant gets --n402d00 to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets --n402d4b to choose it --n402d5e.
171283:28	some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that.	###.###well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent.###that's usually a matter of who to believe --n402524 and what facts to believe --n402543.###.###right.###.###but people who --n402637 d-, don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like --n40268a and what the options are --n4026a5, to ask them --n4026c0 to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see --n402703, i think that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.###.###yeah.###.###in texas here, people tend --n4029e8 to get whipped --n4029fb up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere.###.###right.###.###but in a lot of places, i think people bend over the other way,###but i guess, i guess i like the system that they have --n402cdd in some places where the defendant gets --n402d00 to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets --n402d4b to choose it --n402d5e.
171296:110	but, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, i don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an-, and call them in.	###.###uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere.###.###right.###.###but in a lot of places, i think people bend over the other way,###but i guess, i guess i like the system that they have --n402cdd in some places where the defendant gets --n402d00 to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets --n402d4b to choose it --n402d5e.### some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that.###.###oh really.###.###i kind of like that system.###yeah.###.###yeah.### that's, that's not a bad system.###but i, i do think it needs --n403190 to be shaken --n4031a3 up a little bit.###.###yeah.###.
171338:68	but i think about, uh, about a year ago, uh, i bought a product from some company down at, uh, in atlanta, georgia.	###where,###and, uh, there would be more honest settlements instead of this, uh, tugging of people's heart strings and, uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by --n403945 giving them or giving them two million dollars --n403970 to make up for the pain and suffering.###.###uh-huh.### put-, putting on a act or whatever.###.###.###uh-huh.###exactly,###exactly.###.###so. in, i think, i-, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government###but,###.###.###have you had that experience recently.###.######recently,###i can't really say recently.
171344:39	but i found that, uh, it was made --n400653 of some material which --n40066a actually ended up --n40067d rusting uh, after,	###.###uh-huh.###exactly,###exactly.###.###so. in, i think, i-, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government###but,###.###.###have you had that experience recently.###.######recently,###i can't really say recently.###but i think about, uh, about a year ago, uh, i bought a product from some company down at, uh, in atlanta, georgia.###i believe it was one of these, uh, one of these, uh, mixers. these, like these juice machines###and, uh the, uh, the blade they sent me --n400477 at first that --n40048a went into the machine, it looked, you know, perfectly okay###.###oh, yeah.###.
171458:48	and they will gladly, no questions asked --n4030ae, take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore.	###.###but i just felt like, well at least i did something.###maybe they'll fix it.###they might work on that, you know.###.###right,###right.###.###but i find attitudes are more of a problem.###service is more of a problem.###.###i find,###up here in the northeast, we have, uh, well w-, we have these mail order companies like l l bean###and, uh, they are famous for, i guess --n402aa3, having really top-notch service.###they've got, uh###.###really.###.###i mean i've, i've, i, i have friends and family who --n402c37 order from them because you can, you can literally,###i've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year, wear it for a year and a half, and even after, like eighteen months of, you know, reasonably satisfactory use, they will accept it in any condition --n402edd
171678:13	they've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.	###.###.###yeah.### have you, do you use a standard, uh, a standard spread sheet###or i mean,###.###.###oh so,###.###okay.###i'm not as ashamed --n40006b to claim them --n40007e this year as i have been so.###.###well, it,### let's put it this way.###we've got the new england patriots up here###so.###.###oh yeah.###right. well,###.
171692:24	and, uh, they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth.	###we've got the new england patriots up here###so.###.###oh yeah.###right. well,###.###they've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.###.###really.###.###yeah.###.###why.###.###um, well, uh, partly due to ownership.###you know, uh, victor kiam owned the, uh, the patriots uh, for a period of a number of years###.###uh-huh.###.###and he always had this, uh, this wonderful quality of c-, being able --n400611 to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something --n400658
171693:31	and it recently was sold --n4008af to, uh, some other people	###so.###.###oh yeah.###right. well,###.###they've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.###.###really.###.###yeah.###.###why.###.###um, well, uh, partly due to ownership.###you know, uh, victor kiam owned the, uh, the patriots uh, for a period of a number of years###.###uh-huh.###.###and he always had this, uh, this wonderful quality of c-, being able --n400611 to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something --n400658###and, uh, they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth.
171768:27	and that's suppose --n401ec2 to be some of the, uh, the male bonding and the, and the, uh, the male instincts, i guess --n401f3d, or something about the, uh,	###well, i just started --n4015a6 to this year because of these silly raiders that --n4015d5 didn't do very well,###.###.###but i've been trying more this year.###i think i know a little more than i use --n401752 to.###.###yeah.###.###i never knew very much at all###so i'm trying.###.###well, it's a good past time, you know.###.###yeah.###.###particularly football.###they say, uh, i-, football attracts more men because of the, you know, y-, the, you see the, the physical aggression on the field###and supposedly, psychologists say that, uh, that, uh, men take out their frustrations by --n401c59 watching football###and, you know, they get together with a bunch of guys### and they, uh, uh, and they have a good time and everything
171919:12	we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more.	###.###yeah.###.###you, the,###well the same thing.###.###yeah.###.### we, we talked our wives,###there's about six or eight guys that --n4042e6 we use --n4042f5 to go out for these games.###and, uh, we talked our wives into --n4043f9 going with us one time###and they had a real good time###and it was, basically, for the social atmosphere.###.###right.###and that's the thing, you know.###.###you go, you know three or four hours before the game.###you go --n40469b set up.###we set a table up,
171919:19	we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more.	###.###yeah.###.###you, the,###well the same thing.###.###yeah.###.### we, we talked our wives,###there's about six or eight guys that --n4042e6 we use --n4042f5 to go out for these games.###and, uh, we talked our wives into --n4043f9 going with us one time###and they had a real good time###and it was, basically, for the social atmosphere.###.###right.###and that's the thing, you know.###.###you go, you know three or four hours before the game.###you go --n40469b set up.###we set a table up,
171919:92	we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more.	###.###yeah.###.###you, the,###well the same thing.###.###yeah.###.### we, we talked our wives,###there's about six or eight guys that --n4042e6 we use --n4042f5 to go out for these games.###and, uh, we talked our wives into --n4043f9 going with us one time###and they had a real good time###and it was, basically, for the social atmosphere.###.###right.###and that's the thing, you know.###.###you go, you know three or four hours before the game.###you go --n40469b set up.###we set a table up,
171931:87	that you miss --n404b6f --n404b76 sitting home in your parlor, you know, uh, with, with a six pack of beer and some, uh, potato chips, you know	###and it was, basically, for the social atmosphere.###.###right.###and that's the thing, you know.###.###you go, you know three or four hours before the game.###you go --n40469b set up.###we set a table up,###we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more.###.###yeah.###.###.### but, but that whole,### it, it's not so much, sure the contest itself and the game itself,###but it's the whole atmosphere of playing, uh, of going to a game.###i-,###.###yeah.###.
171967:54	i, i kind of agree with that, because i think in some cases, uh, the jury may not even have, the information about other crimes the person has committed --n400694.	###yeah.###well, in high school i went to every football game###and, well, i twirled, you know.###.###.###yep.###.###and i, you know, i didn't,###i still don't know that much about football, obviously.###but i still had a good time. you know,###.###well foot-,###.###.###well, th-, the question was talking about the juries###and, uh, one of the things i thought about --n4000e6 was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having --n400119, that, especially for repeat offenders that, uh,###maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who --n4002d7 come back again and again.###uh, so that, uh, a judge, i think --n4003c9, would be the most appropriate person --n4003f0 to, uh, to be able --n400413 to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day.###.###right.
171972:37	uh, i, i think that in some cases that's considered --n400846 to prejudice the current case	###yep.###.###and i, you know, i didn't,###i still don't know that much about football, obviously.###but i still had a good time. you know,###.###well foot-,###.###.###well, th-, the question was talking about the juries###and, uh, one of the things i thought about --n4000e6 was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having --n400119, that, especially for repeat offenders that, uh,###maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who --n4002d7 come back again and again.###uh, so that, uh, a judge, i think --n4003c9, would be the most appropriate person --n4003f0 to, uh, to be able --n400413 to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day.###.###right.### i, i kind of agree with that, because i think in some cases, uh, the jury may not even have, the information about other crimes the person has committed --n400694.###.###.###right.###.
172002:14	there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed --n401599 a jury trial --n4015ac.	###yeah.###see i agree with you.###uh, one thing i heard --n400c61 was this, where they have, instead of --n400c94 going to the regular court, they have a, a mock court --n400cd3.###i mean, it's supposed --n400e55 to be all legal and everything.###uh, you go###and you present your case,###the other side presents their case###and you're done with it.###it's almost like the night court we see --n40104f on t v.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and, uh, but it's not that we have, uh, such,###it didn't backlog or all of the, uh, the cases that --n40123c are, uh, all ready pending.###uh, so i,###that was one thing i thought about --n4013c7 that --n4013d2 would be really neat if we could do it that way.###.###in other words, not, not,###.###.
172039:16	but i meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going --n4023c4 to have a judge here --n4023df.	###sure.###.###so i'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we, uh, take that, you know,###.###.###that would require a change in the bill of rights, i believe --n401ddc###and so,###.###oh, yes### and, and i wasn't, i didn't mean that.###.###oh,###oh, okay.###.### i, i didn't mean that,###no.###because, i mean, gee whiz, if i was, uh, uh, didn't have that right, you know, not to have a jury that,###oh###yes,###i would feel, uh, you're right --n40229b, that my civil rights had been violated --n4022c2.
172194:39	i've found that most of homework assignments mumblex really require some sort of computer, uh, simulation or analysis,	###.###.###actually, i've been involved in electronics --n400032 a long time. uh, in computers###and i have really resisted the impulse --n4000fc to get one for the home. uh, up until, i guess, maybe about a year and a half ago,###.###oh yeah.###.###i got one --n400298 for my son. a, a macintosh uh, l c.###.###uh-huh.###.###it's a real easy to use --n4003ad color, uh, computer###and i got a very nice printer that --n400469 goes along with it###and he uses it for his school work.###.###uh-huh.###well, i've, i'm currently in school###so i, i've had an i b m clone --n400659, i guess --n400670, for a couple of years now, which i've been trying, continually upgrading --n4006b7 i guess.###and, uh, i've found, i've found that i pretty much become addicted to it###and i can't really,
172225:11	i have some games --n401102, of course, which i play --n401125 on there	###.###at georgia tech.###.###i see.###.###yeah,###so.###.###in engineering.###.###yes, actually.###.###so that explains wha-, all the, uh, computer assignments.###.###yeah,###it, uh,###.###well, do you use your p c for things other than explicit computer work.###.###um, sure.
172264:114	i mean, obviously, i do most of my, almost all of my report writing on, on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments.	###uh, but now i find myself using the computer,###even the computer at work is primarily a, uh, word processing system and a communication system.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah.###do you use email and like that.###.###yes.###emil is, probably pulls down a third a-, of all my time.###.###yeah.###it's,### i, i, uh, i have modem mumblex night computer###so i can log into the sys-, the, uh, network at georgia tech and access my account through there, which is, which --n401e8c can be useful.###but, uh, yeah### that's, that and word processing is###while i tend --n4020c7 to,
172441:20	still's that way to some extent.	### i'm, i'm not sure i understand what you mean --n40200a.###.###well, i mean, i think,###i was in germany, you know, for several years###.###right.###.###and i'd a lot rather --n402208 pay taxes here and have what we have --n40222f, then have --n402246 to live there.###.###oh, you mean, lowest end of living in spite of lower, higher taxes.###yeah.###.###higher taxes.###yeah.###.###i suppose that's true,###yeah.###uh, probably m-, less so --n40253a now than it was ten years ago or whatever###but,###.
172589:128	when you have the, when you have the, uh, the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has --n401b97 --n401b9e, and you can, uh, offer some incentive	###that's right.###.###uh, i guess that would be up there.###uh, i'm not sure if i would rank, uh, how i would rank that --n4012ac next to, say compared to retirement###or, uh, uh, uh, pretax savings was another thing that i think --n40143f is a a great, a great benefit mumblex.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###and i, i think it's really something that the, uh, the government ought --n40161c to encourage --n40162b more because, uh, there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country --n40167a and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in, uh, germany and japan --n4016e1.###uh,###.###right.###.###.###well, it --n40199c's a lot easier to, to save it when you don't get your hands on it first --n4019f3.###.###right.
172629:33	there ought --n402b7a to be, uh, uh, some compromise that --n402bad could, where, uh, where the person would be guaranteed --n402bec a, uh, career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh, in exchange for a longer period of time --n402c5f.	###uh-huh.###.###uh, i, their, uh, i know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which i think --n402547 is too short. uh###.###oh, i do too.###.###uh, uh, i really think that we need --n40270a to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks --n40274d.###.###oh, i think, i think it --n40287e's just a crying shame, uh, for a mother to have --n4028b9 to go back to work at six weeks.###.###.###right,###and, uh,###.###she isn't recovered.###and, uh the infant needs her desperately, at that point and time.###.###there,###.###.
172656:9	at least some companies.	###.### it's, uh, it's so important to families then### and, uh, and yet anybody who --n402fa0's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant --n402fdb to give that up.###.###oh, sure.###.###uh,###.###especially in this day and age.###.###that,###.###you don't want --n4031d2 to start over again anywhere.###.###yeah,###you're right.###i think you've put your finger on the one benefit that i, that i would most like --n4032fe to see, uh, --n403319 changed --n403324. uh, the, uh, parental leave.###.###well, i think they're at, they're com-, they've come a long way.###uh,
172669:50	there's no other way. i mean uh, unless they're part of some extended family which --n403b57 is unlikely.	###.###yeah,###you're right.###i think you've put your finger on the one benefit that i, that i would most like --n4032fe to see, uh, --n403319 changed --n403324. uh, the, uh, parental leave.###.###well, i think they're at, they're com-, they've come a long way.###uh,###at least some companies.###some of them, uh,###my girlfriend, in particular, that --n4036cc works for a, a rental car agency###.###right.###.###and, uh, as manager and, uh, they have a very, very poor leave policy###and, uh, i just don't know how, how women do it --n4038d6.###particularly, single parents who --n4039a3 don't have the support at the other end.###uh,###.###right.###they do it by --n403a9d shortchanging their kids.
173112:18	if i only had some place that i could store the, uh, camper top --n404449, i would have it off most of the time.	###yeah.###.###.###uh.###.###.###yeah.###.###but, yeah,### i, i mean, the only thing i think i might get --n403b90, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car,###uh, i would consider --n403d5e going to a, a non, to a normal pickup rather than a, a covered pickup like the one i've got --n403df9. just because there's a lot of times i wished i had, ju-, just an open bed --n403e5c to throw stuff in --n403e73 --n403e7a.###.###right.###mumblex.###.### i'm sure, i'm sure that that's very,###i mean you got one.### it's, that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back###and,###.
173289:7	but some of them are very rich	###i mean, they just have beautiful, beautiful homes###and they have everything.###the kids only wear name brand things to school###and it's one of these things,###.###oh me.###well that makes it hard for you, doesn't it.###.###well it does, you know.###it really does because i'm a single mom and i have a thirteen year old now###and uh, you know, it does.###.###oh, me.###.###.###i mean, we do it to a point###but uh, not to where she feels different --n401cac,###.###yeah.###.
173724:18	and by definition, for some of us, at least, the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that, uh, you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the, at the local level or bigger votes at the national level.	###yeah.###the immediacy just isn't there.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, uh, i also think that one of the problems###and, actually, i don't think this, i think this is a cultural problem.###the, uh, problem with public education is really, uh, really a problem with the culture.###and, i guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like california, for example, where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school --n40154e###and you can't get a tax levy passed --n4016a2.###uh, people are, uh, reluctant --n401724 to pass, uh, school tax levies even, uh, when the money is needed --n40176f or would be well spent --n40178a because it's, uh, they don't have kids in the schools.###.###right.###.###i think that's a, a loss of civic virtue and a loss of, uh, uh, the cultural attitude that we used --n4019f4 to have --n401a03 that education was first even if it wasn't our kids.###i think that's, uh, that's the principal problem is that, uh, people no longer see it as, uh, as their problem###and there's an immediate problem.###.###right.###it --n401dfb troubles me too tha-, that the priority seems --n401e26 to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good
173813:37	well, when mine were growing up --n400567, i did some traveling and but not that extensively	###uh.###.###and we had five.###.###you've been through the fun part.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###and how about yourself.###.###i have a four and a half and a three.###.###oh.###well.###.###so. it's,### i, i'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way, in the way it's done --n4003cc --n4003d3 now and then.###.###yeah.
174160:14	i've got some friends that --n401b6f are lawyers	### if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances who --n401719's --n401724 to say.###.###yeah.###.###.###it,###there would be much more of that.###.###yeah###no doubt.###are you involved in the legal system at all.###.###no.###but i. i tend --n4019a8 to follow it --n4019bb just to, just to know what --n4019de's going on.###.###okay.###.###.###yeah,###yeah.
174196:39	when i was, a couple of years ago, involved in some pretrial stuff --n40268a and	###.###yeah.###.###it's more in how you present it --n4020ad versus, you know, who --n4020cc's right.###.###i'm sure of it.###because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint. and who --n402272 can argue their case better.###.###yep.###.###.###uh, it's kind of weird.###i don't know,### you i always think about --n4024b8 watching the people's court or something. and how weird those cases get --n4024f7.###.###.###i know.###.###it's just,###.
174303:29	and, in fact, they're even letting some go.	###yeah.###i'm not really sure how we could change the legal system --n4040e0 to make it better --n4040f7.###mumblex.###.###yeah.###it's,###there are too many big problems, you know.### there's, there's such a backlog of court cases right now.###you know, to try --n40437d to get them all in in a good time###.###i know.###.###and we already have too many lawyers as it is.###.###yeah.###and if it's criminal cases we, you can't put them in jail because there's no room left.###.###yeah.###yeah,###that's true.
174382:47	if some, if it --n401574 were possible to market some, uh, form of, uh, space technology, you know, to, uh, uh, to make it equitable, it might severely help the economy, you know, in the, in the, uh, respect that, you know, there's endless amounts of research --n401693 to be done --n4016a6. endless amounts of resources and and whatnot,	###i used --n400c7f to think when i was, when i was younger --n400cba that, uh, by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###uh, frustrating at times.###.###uh-huh.###.###i don't know what you think --n400f62 about all that.###.###well, uh, yo-, i, uh, i'm kind of young.###i'm only twenty-two###and so, uh, uh, i'm not, you know,###there's a lot that --n4011e7's happened in my lifetime as far as, uh, you know, with the space shuttle and all. although plans to, uh, go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted --n40127e in comparison to, uh, the sixties.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, although i have a,### i, i kind of wonder uh,
174386:30	it would be great if we could find some way to, to, uh, use that to boost the economy --n401a94.	###.###uh, frustrating at times.###.###uh-huh.###.###i don't know what you think --n400f62 about all that.###.###well, uh, yo-, i, uh, i'm kind of young.###i'm only twenty-two###and so, uh, uh, i'm not, you know,###there's a lot that --n4011e7's happened in my lifetime as far as, uh, you know, with the space shuttle and all. although plans to, uh, go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted --n40127e in comparison to, uh, the sixties.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, although i have a,### i, i kind of wonder uh,### if some, if it --n401574 were possible to market some, uh, form of, uh, space technology, you know, to, uh, uh, to make it equitable, it might severely help the economy, you know, in the, in the, uh, respect that, you know, there's endless amounts of research --n401693 to be done --n4016a6. endless amounts of resources and and whatnot,###.###yeah.###.
174392:103	i've always, uh, felt that, uh, uh, one of the long-term solutions that, at least a few of our problems would be to have, uh, some sort of, uh, solar power satellites up.	###.###well, uh, yo-, i, uh, i'm kind of young.###i'm only twenty-two###and so, uh, uh, i'm not, you know,###there's a lot that --n4011e7's happened in my lifetime as far as, uh, you know, with the space shuttle and all. although plans to, uh, go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted --n40127e in comparison to, uh, the sixties.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, although i have a,### i, i kind of wonder uh,### if some, if it --n401574 were possible to market some, uh, form of, uh, space technology, you know, to, uh, uh, to make it equitable, it might severely help the economy, you know, in the, in the, uh, respect that, you know, there's endless amounts of research --n401693 to be done --n4016a6. endless amounts of resources and and whatnot,###.###yeah.###.###it would be great if we could find some way to, to, uh, use that to boost the economy --n401a94.###.###well, yeah.###.###.###well, the, uh, uh,
174409:147	so the side effects of doing that which i think --n402506 would be good, you know, very, very good for al-, for everyone in the long run is, uh, is it, some of the other things i'd like --n4025b9 to see --n4025c8 happen would happen also,	###.###.###well, the, uh, uh,###i've always, uh, felt that, uh, uh, one of the long-term solutions that, at least a few of our problems would be to have, uh, some sort of, uh, solar power satellites up.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, because that's a, uh, you know, in singularly renewable resource that --n401ed7 doesn't do it, that --n401ef6 doesn't require, uh, uh, any particularly nasty environment impact.###.###exactly.###.###and you can just get as much power as you need up there.###.###uh-huh.###.###it's just a matter of how big you build it --n4021d5 --n4021dc.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and, of course, the side effects of this is that you have --n4022d1 to have, uh, lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no mumblex things that i think we should be doing --n402348.
174455:135	the only commitments that they're interested in --n402e1b making --n402e26 or even talking about --n402e3d are ones for flash value like, uh, the trip to mars. which --n402e80 is, would, would produce some useful scientific research and so forth,	###.###that makes a lot of sense.###.###the only problem is, of course, that, uh, that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want --n402b5c to put things like that up there.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###speakera50-1*t50-1.###yeah.###speakerbnan*t50-1.###speakerb50-2*t50-2.###and they want --n402cef to do the research###speakeranan*t50-2.###.###and uh, they're all you know, nor-,###.###yeah.###.###speakerb53-1*t53-1.
174570:7	in some ways i don't like it because it's like they're playing god.	###that's,###.### go ahead.###.### go ahead.###texas is too.###texas, i saw on t v the other night --n4008d8, is the, has had forty-six in like the past several years.###.###yeah.###.###so they're pretty hip on it too, i guess --n400a48.###they do it by lethal injection, at huntsville.###.###yeah,###okay.###i think florida still uses electric chair.###.###yeah.###.###uh, i don't, i don't know.
174581:22	and, of course, you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money --n401033 keeping people in jail or not.	###they do it by lethal injection, at huntsville.###.###yeah,###okay.###i think florida still uses electric chair.###.###yeah.###.###uh, i don't, i don't know.###in some ways i don't like it because it's like they're playing god.###.###yeah.###.###and that's not,###i don't think that's right.###but on the other hand, there's a lot of advantages to it.###.###yeah.###.###i think crime rates deterred --n400f54 a little bit by using it
174795:103	and i guess the only drawback --n400ca4 i can see --n400cbb to, to drug testing is in, in case you are on some sort of medication that --n400d1a might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.	###.###where do you work --n40081a.###.###uh, well i'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon.###.###oh, okay.###oh, okay.###.###and i, i just came from saint paul. uh, --n400997 interviewing with three m.###.###huh.###.###.###oh, great.###.###and, uh, they have a policy for, uh, testing.### if you, if they make you an offer, then they'll test you right before you start.###.###right.###.
174795:129	and i guess the only drawback --n400ca4 i can see --n400cbb to, to drug testing is in, in case you are on some sort of medication that --n400d1a might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.	###.###where do you work --n40081a.###.###uh, well i'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon.###.###oh, okay.###oh, okay.###.###and i, i just came from saint paul. uh, --n400997 interviewing with three m.###.###huh.###.###.###oh, great.###.###and, uh, they have a policy for, uh, testing.### if you, if they make you an offer, then they'll test you right before you start.###.###right.###.
174795:164	and i guess the only drawback --n400ca4 i can see --n400cbb to, to drug testing is in, in case you are on some sort of medication that --n400d1a might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.	###.###where do you work --n40081a.###.###uh, well i'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon.###.###oh, okay.###oh, okay.###.###and i, i just came from saint paul. uh, --n400997 interviewing with three m.###.###huh.###.###.###oh, great.###.###and, uh, they have a policy for, uh, testing.### if you, if they make you an offer, then they'll test you right before you start.###.###right.###.
174814:31	like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind, you know, what are they going --n40146a to do --n401479 about that.	###.###and i guess the only drawback --n400ca4 i can see --n400cbb to, to drug testing is in, in case you are on some sort of medication that --n400d1a might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###but i-,###.###yeah.###and that, that definitely happens, you know.###i mean those, the drug tests, sure they're accurate###but there's always that margin of error.###.###yeah.###.###and that's, that's something to be aware of --n401226.###another thing is, a lot of times, you know, they aren't that accurate.###they aren't that sensitive.
174864:19	so, uh, there's some noise on this end.	###.###they test you, uh, before they, before you start or before you even interview###.###right.###.###or,###.###uh, they essentially,###no###i sure don't, uh,### they essentially, uh, they essentially, uh, made me the offer and then, and then, uh, did the drug testing thing after that.###so, uh, it was one of those things where you go through the, the general battery of all their tests --n402336### and, and then, they essentially give you the offer###.###uh-huh.###.###and then at that point they'll, they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that.###.###oh.###.
174932:42	and while i don't do any drugs myself, i've seen some people who --n403d83 work there, uh, you know, smoking a joint or whatever.	###and we both had --n40352c to go through drug testing at the same time.###so, one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process --n40361c.###but, uh,###.### did, do they test you at, right now, at work too.###.###no,###no.###that's one thing they don't do --n40384c is, is drug testing while you're on the job.###.###okay.###.###uh, i think, i think the unwritten rule is, yeah, expect it###but they don't do it.###.###oh.###.###you know, so. that's good i guess --n403b30.###i don't know.###i mean, i, uh, i have gone to a couple of parties since, since that time
175399:7	even some of the immediate things that i need --n401141 to know --n401150, i don't know it until the next hour	###see, wh-, when you're with a big company or a big organization --n40004e, a lot of times, uh, you know, the benefits are good### and, and, you know, the pay is regular###but, uh, you know, sometimes you don't get tuned --n400283 in to what --n400296's going on.###and i, i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that, that, uh, that anybody could get --n4003ff in, in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you, you get --n400466 to know what --n400479's going on --n40048c.###and maybe that's, that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to, to do --n4007a6.### what's, what's your feeling about benefits --n4008da.###what sort of benefits would you like --n40098b to get --n40099a from a big company.###.###well, since i'm kind of on the, the older side, you know, i, i, i just feel like, uh, when i start --n400ae5 talking about benefits --n400af8, i talk about, i'm concerned about medical benefits.###uh, my, uh, my husband works for mcdonald douglas###and so his benefits, his medical benefits are so excellent, you know,###that's really great.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, i work for, uh, wes-, a bank, western financial.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, they don't let me know really about anything that --n401055's going on.
175612:19	uh, if it was some you know, coming into the store and stuff, then she would ha-, whoever --n4032af made the purchase would have had --n4032ce find some kind of, uh, you know, document	###uh-huh.###.###uh, and apparently what --n4029ce had happened is someone used her social security number.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and, and i've, i've heard recently that, uh, uh, that this is a common occurrence where people are using s-, you know,###they use joe blow's so-, uh, social security number, uh, and can, uh, potentially ruin someone's credit.###.###uh-huh.###if you know a person's social security number and their mailing address, i-, and their mother's maiden name, uh, you can, basically, become that, uh, person.###.###.###huh.###.###uh, if the purchase was made --n402fdf mail order, they should have a record of where it was shipped --n40301a to --n403025###.###uh-huh.###.###and since it wasn't shipped --n40313c to her address, she could prove, you know, that it wasn't her.
175612:112	uh, if it was some you know, coming into the store and stuff, then she would ha-, whoever --n4032af made the purchase would have had --n4032ce find some kind of, uh, you know, document	###uh-huh.###.###uh, and apparently what --n4029ce had happened is someone used her social security number.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and, and i've, i've heard recently that, uh, uh, that this is a common occurrence where people are using s-, you know,###they use joe blow's so-, uh, social security number, uh, and can, uh, potentially ruin someone's credit.###.###uh-huh.###if you know a person's social security number and their mailing address, i-, and their mother's maiden name, uh, you can, basically, become that, uh, person.###.###.###huh.###.###uh, if the purchase was made --n402fdf mail order, they should have a record of where it was shipped --n40301a to --n403025###.###uh-huh.###.###and since it wasn't shipped --n40313c to her address, she could prove, you know, that it wasn't her.
175669:10	and for some of them it was just kind of, i don't know, not so much a holiday,	###.###uh-huh.###.### ended up being,###i was in the last, last lottery.###.###yeah.###.###and i was glad it was over by then.###.###right.###.###i've never really totally understood what our purpose --n400a89 was --n400a94 over there.###just because, you know, we didn't really do anything when we went over --n400b80 it seems like --n400b93.###.###yeah.###.###you know, we, uh,###those people that i know --n400d07,###i work with several that --n400d7b were over there,
175693:49	uh, i guess you'd have --n40181d to call them great men in some sense.	###and then they'd, come back###.###.###and you know.###.###yeah.###.###but that they weren't really allowed --n4011e9 to do anything.###i, uh,###to me it seems like we only went halfway. if even halfway.###.###yeah,###it's funny.###tonight i was, uh, helping my kid with an essay on, uh, stalin.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, uh, in world war two, the personalties of stalin, hitler and churchill more or less defined the war --n40153e###and actually when you think back on the big events of the war --n4016a2, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three,
175702:23	and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the vietnam war. that the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had --n401b53 to draw a line and, and defend it.	###to me it seems like we only went halfway. if even halfway.###.###yeah,###it's funny.###tonight i was, uh, helping my kid with an essay on, uh, stalin.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, uh, in world war two, the personalties of stalin, hitler and churchill more or less defined the war --n40153e###and actually when you think back on the big events of the war --n4016a2, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three,###uh, i guess you'd have --n40181d to call them great men in some sense.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, they're certainly all leaders### and, uh, and, uh, with their nations pretty, pretty solidly behind each one of them.###.###yeah.###.
175724:80	well, i, i, i think we did, i think we did learn some lessons that we weren't, uh, we weren't prepared for --n402c24,	###.###uh-huh.###.### looking back, it seems like that was only partly true. that, uh, there might have been a better place to draw the line --n401e7e.###uh, i guess you can, i guess you can say that a, a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight, uh, brought the cold war to an end.###but i don't think you can just fight anywhere just, just in order --n402207 to, uh, call the bully out and beat him.###and i have a feeling that that's part of what --n402372 was involved in the vietnamese war.###they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line, beat them and they wouldn't come forward --n40249e.###.###.###and, uh we were wrong.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i, uh, you know,### the, like i said, the more i hear --n40269a about it, the more i can see each decision that --n4026cd was made --n4026dc as --n4026e7 being understandable --n4026f6.###but the accumulative effect was to really get into a, a hopeless situation where,###and as you say, uh, going halfway was probably worse than, uh, committing, uh, committing to a completely and, uh, winning it, whatever that would mean --n4029e7.###.###yeah.
176211:25	i'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere.	###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###they live with us###and so, of course, we love it. because we get --n4018a5 to see this cute little baby all the time.###but, uh, uh, she just,###uh, she used --n4019ff to work in pre, in the preschool and, and, and child care###and she says after working in there### and, and, you know, here she was a provider###but, you know, there's only so much one person can do --n401ccb.###.###yeah.###.###she said it's so awful.###she said she'll never put her child in a, in a, in a preca-, in a p-, in a preschool.###.###uh-huh.###.
176324:16	and i've got some very definite, uh, opinions about it --n400286. uh, you know, which --n4002a9 haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from, from when they, when they announced it --n40030c. but, uh, developed a little more, i guess, but haven't changed that much.	### i, i quit that job###and i stayed home for awhile longer.###then i went and got a, uh, a job in real estate where i can kind of adjust my time a little bit better --n404bb9.###.###yeah,###a little more flexibility.###you can come and go.###.###yeah,###but, uh, i haven't had any good, really very good experience with child care.###.###yeah.### when, when our kids were small --n404ea4 we had a couple of, uh, good, good women who, uh, --n404ef7 would often c-, uh, get them to come to the house.###.###.###okay.###well, uh, i'll let you start, i guess --n400060.###.###well, uh, yeah,### i, i'm employed --n40014e by a company that --n400165 does do, uh, random drug testing
176346:16	he crashed and killed some people because he was, uh, smoking some marijuana	###are you, uh, in-, involved at all.###.###uh, no.###i mean, i'm not,###my employer does not do that. uh, although, uh, i had an ex-employer that,###uh, the previous job i used --n40081d to have --n40082c, uh, they,### after, i guess a few years after i had started with them they made it --n400924 a condition of employment that you pass a drug test.###.###yes.###.###uh, i, i don't know.###my feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb, uh, if should somebody be under the influence of drugs --n400b94, i, i'd be willing --n400bb7 to support that.###for example, uh, uh, well, uh, uh, train engineers.###.###yeah.###.###because it, you know, uh, like, there was an incident --n400e64 several years ago where an amtrak engineer mumblex you know###.###right.###.
176346:41	he crashed and killed some people because he was, uh, smoking some marijuana	###are you, uh, in-, involved at all.###.###uh, no.###i mean, i'm not,###my employer does not do that. uh, although, uh, i had an ex-employer that,###uh, the previous job i used --n40081d to have --n40082c, uh, they,### after, i guess a few years after i had started with them they made it --n400924 a condition of employment that you pass a drug test.###.###yes.###.###uh, i, i don't know.###my feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb, uh, if should somebody be under the influence of drugs --n400b94, i, i'd be willing --n400bb7 to support that.###for example, uh, uh, well, uh, uh, train engineers.###.###yeah.###.###because it, you know, uh, like, there was an incident --n400e64 several years ago where an amtrak engineer mumblex you know###.###right.###.
176364:70	uh, and so it's, it's required for certain, some form, some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts	###right.###.###he crashed and killed some people because he was, uh, smoking some marijuana###and i guess air traffic controllers --n401092. i wouldn't want them to be on drugs. and airplane pilots.###but where it's not necessary --n4011ae, uh, in that regard, where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property --n40120d uh, i, i'd, i would seriously question it.###.###yeah.###.###uh, so.###.###yeah.###yeah.### it, uh, that's, that's mine.### it, it, you know,### i, i go back,### it, to me, no matter how much the, th-, our company claims it's not a constitutional issue. that, because this is, uh, between a company and an employee it is not, it is not a government --n401718,###it's not,###the constitution doesn't apply.###but i, it, it seems to me that it still should.### i, i, our company's doing it because they're a, uh, government contractor.
176374:99	first off we don't, we don't have enough courage to, uh, pick out the people that, that --n4020a0 have some sort of indication of possible drug usage, uh, because that would offend them, uh, if they, if they weren't.	###yeah.###yeah.### it, uh, that's, that's mine.### it, it, you know,### i, i go back,### it, to me, no matter how much the, th-, our company claims it's not a constitutional issue. that, because this is, uh, between a company and an employee it is not, it is not a government --n401718,###it's not,###the constitution doesn't apply.###but i, it, it seems to me that it still should.### i, i, our company's doing it because they're a, uh, government contractor.###uh, and so it's, it's required for certain, some form, some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts###and i'd, i'd,###.###so it's the government that --n401e3a's mandating it to a certain extent..###.###yes.###okay.### an-, and our company has taken that and gone all the way.###say,###okay, uh,
176628:53	i i built it --n40393a two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff.	###.###yeah,###yeah.###that's not near, like building a house or anything###.###.###but,###.###right.###.###yeah,###those are nice.###especially when you get done --n4036ed, you've got something, you know.###i don't know,###i like them.###you just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. have a barbecue###.###yeah.###.###.
176651:43	a, a contractor friend helped me, uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work	###.###i,###.###yeah,###that sounds nice.###.###.###all done --n403b0f by yourself,###huh.###.###yeah.###i had a friend with a tractor who --n403baf dug the pier holes###.### designed,###.###so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts.### and, uh and then the rest of it i just did --n403d9e.###.###yeah.###.
176780:98	rodney got beat --n4016de up because he, he, you know, he pur-, you know, he involved himself in some sub, self-destructive behavior.	###uh, and th-, and the problems that, that --n400fa1 has come that --n400fb8 has come from this decision that that jury came to --n400feb after all of us witnessed what we did --n401012 with the video tape beating. uh just makes you wonder i guess whether or not they,###.###well won't,###well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that###but then then, you know, the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently###.###uh-huh.###.###and, you know, the other two guys sat in the car###.### that's, that's bad.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they didn't get beat --n40160d up. you know.###.###no.###it,###.
176795:27	you know, some, some black guy with capital is going --n401bb8 to come in and invest in that area.	###and they didn't get beat --n40160d up. you know.###.###no.###it,###.###rodney got beat --n4016de up because he, he, you know, he pur-, you know, he involved himself in some sub, self-destructive behavior.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, uh, just like the burning and looting is self-destruct.###.###uh-huh.###.###everybody says well this is the nineties###.###oh, yes.###.###and they're going --n401a6e to rebuild###and it'll be even better.###hey, what do you think --n401b35,
176908:22	and you say you have some strong feelings about, uh, the issue.	###oh, that's interesting.###.###yes.### an-, and so, uh, uh, and, and the reason i'm doing this whole thing --n404502 is because rick, who --n40451d's another government employee wanted a spe-, segments of my speech, that that --n40456c were done --n40457b a year ago###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and he wanted another collection a year later.###.###oh.###.###and so this is my seventh call.###a year ago i did eleven calls.###.###oh, i see.###.###and so that's, that's why, uh, uh, that's why i'm religiously getting on the phone --n4049d5 because i have a unique, you know, i have a unique situation here in that if i don't participate,###.###.
176952:43	they always want --n4013cc to be able --n4013df to, uh, do some brain draining.	###but they had two thousand applications.###.###yeah.###.###and i know that there are a lot of foreigners, uh, here, you know, doing my line of work.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, of course, i'm not perfectly happy about --n400bec not having a job.###.###right.###.###so, how do you feel --n400cb4.###.###well, i'm a little bit ambivalent.### the problem with, uh, and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing --n400df0 to discuss it, uh, in, in terms of what, uh, --n400e33 really is driving it.###they're not willing --n401053 to tell the truth. the same way with, uh, issues of, uh, race and things like that.###i mean right now, uh, i believe there are two policies that, uh, that the government uses --n4011ec --n4011f3 to modulate immigration.###three actually.###one is at the high end, uh,
176960:92	at the bottom end, they, uh, are always willing --n4017ba to, uh, let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the, powerful people in that area.	###and, of course, i'm not perfectly happy about --n400bec not having a job.###.###right.###.###so, how do you feel --n400cb4.###.###well, i'm a little bit ambivalent.### the problem with, uh, and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing --n400df0 to discuss it, uh, in, in terms of what, uh, --n400e33 really is driving it.###they're not willing --n401053 to tell the truth. the same way with, uh, issues of, uh, race and things like that.###i mean right now, uh, i believe there are two policies that, uh, that the government uses --n4011ec --n4011f3 to modulate immigration.###three actually.###one is at the high end, uh,###they always want --n4013cc to be able --n4013df to, uh, do some brain draining.###they always like --n4014a9 to be able --n4014bc to attract the, uh, einsteins or the professor chou###or, you know.###.###right.###.###they'd like --n401605 to be able --n401618 to get the top people in any field###and so they can almost always find room for someone like that.
177013:13	but there's some differences in the immigrants, that, that we're getting --n403568 now.	###but if you let them, yeah. if you let them in a million at a time, it wouldn't make that, you know, it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population.###but po-, politically and economically.###.###oh, my gosh.###.###.### have you been, have you been to southern florida.###.###yeah,###well i know about it.###uh, i mean it's, it is now with haitians the way it was --n402e99 with cubans, uh, twenty years ago.###.###well, i mean and the two of them together.###i mean we can,###it's just as well you know,###it's hardly america anymore.###.###on the other hand, you know, the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial american spirit than our first generation immigrant.###so there's, uh, there's a lot --n403327 to be said --n40333a for having a steady stream of people who --n403365 know how it is --n40337c someplace else coming in.###.
177102:83	and the thing that --n402502 just was in the local news bulletin was, somebody has, uh, ter-, made some special, uh, polymers that --n402575 have the ability to, uh, make certain actinide elements adhere to them.	###ah,###but if somebody can make a regulation about it, they will.###.###well what other, we-, we-, what, uh, what unique things you think, uh, that you can do --n401a2f about it in, in what, in los alamos.###.###well, uh,###.###uh, other, other than nuking it.###.###yes,###other than nuking it.###.###.###um, in fact, los alamos, uh, has, uh, done a fair amount of research, uh, in recycling things in general.###um, it, it involves, for instance, uh, creating biological organisms which --n401f2e can remove heavy elements like selenium, and barium and, uh, other things from, uh, waste material in general. and, uh, and purify the waste of specific, uh, uh, nasty elements.###.###well, isn't that a, that's a, that's pretty, uh, upscale, uh, trash, uh, uh, situation.###i don't think anybody around here would understand all the, all those exotic techniques, you know, getting rid --n4023ba of the heavy metals.###.###.
177105:58	uh, uh, they've, uh, looked at, uh, plutonium and uranium and, uh, some other similar things --n4027d0 to try --n4027df to remove those from radio active waste	###well what other, we-, we-, what, uh, what unique things you think, uh, that you can do --n401a2f about it in, in what, in los alamos.###.###well, uh,###.###uh, other, other than nuking it.###.###yes,###other than nuking it.###.###.###um, in fact, los alamos, uh, has, uh, done a fair amount of research, uh, in recycling things in general.###um, it, it involves, for instance, uh, creating biological organisms which --n401f2e can remove heavy elements like selenium, and barium and, uh, other things from, uh, waste material in general. and, uh, and purify the waste of specific, uh, uh, nasty elements.###.###well, isn't that a, that's a, that's pretty, uh, upscale, uh, trash, uh, uh, situation.###i don't think anybody around here would understand all the, all those exotic techniques, you know, getting rid --n4023ba of the heavy metals.###.###.###and the thing that --n402502 just was in the local news bulletin was, somebody has, uh, ter-, made some special, uh, polymers that --n402575 have the ability to, uh, make certain actinide elements adhere to them.###.###.
